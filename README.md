# TwitterUserTweets
This program `TwitterUserTweets.jar` takes a file full of Twitter screen names (e.g., `@BarackObama`), and for each screen name, creates a txt of all the person's tweets. Speed is approx 30k-40k users/day.

For convenience I have provided TwitterIDToName.jar, which converts a file full of Twitter IDs to screen names. Output goes to stdout (usually Terminal or Command Prompt), so you save the output from stdout, or pipe/append the output to a text file (`>` and `>>` operators). Speed is approx 600k-800k conversions/day.

`/bin`, `/jars`, and `/src` contain the source code for TwitterUserTweets.jar.
