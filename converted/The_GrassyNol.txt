Fri Jul 31 14:58:30 PDT 2015 --  Wheeler called Sandy and asked not to be traded? Damn. Okay Wheeler. I like you a little more
Fri Jul 31 14:59:45 PDT 2015 --  Gomez made the most sense but I really wanted Cespedes from the start. Needed the middle of the order RH bat. https://twitter.com/metsonmymind/status/627236879243550721 …

Fri Jul 31 13:46:09 PDT 2015 --  Thanks to the @tigers organization, my teammates & of course, the fans for your support this season…NYC, see you soon!
Fri Jul 31 13:21:04 PDT 2015 --  Gomez woulda been dope though
Fri Jul 31 13:20:54 PDT 2015 --  Gomez who??
Fri Jul 31 13:10:09 PDT 2015 --  Holy shit this could be incredibly fun. We added some much needed hype to this lineup/roster. September here we come! #LGM #Mets
Fri Jul 31 12:53:37 PDT 2015 --  Cespedes will look awesome in the orange and blue. #mets
Fri Jul 31 12:53:07 PDT 2015 --  YES!!
Fri Jul 31 12:52:08 PDT 2015 --  Will not transpire
Fri Jul 31 12:49:54 PDT 2015 --  Please not again lol
Fri Jul 31 11:41:24 PDT 2015 --  Right? These last 2 months CAN NOT be played with this offense. https://twitter.com/Cavey10/status/627186481069731840 …

Fri Jul 31 09:52:04 PDT 2015 --  If we get Byrd I probably won't watch the Mets again this year
Fri Jul 31 09:50:42 PDT 2015 --  The #Mets are seriously unbelievable. How does no one think this franchise is run like a complete joke is beyond me
Fri Jul 31 07:26:26 PDT 2015 --  Grandy in RF just doesn't make sense. https://twitter.com/WE_ARE_MET_FANS/status/627122819919319040 …

Fri Jul 31 07:10:48 PDT 2015 --  Re: Bruce, appears Mets are strong favorite to land him. Cannot block trades there and would fit.
Fri Jul 31 07:08:10 PDT 2015 --  Lmao this isn't NY. This is the Mets. https://twitter.com/MetsFamily/status/627118272052391936 …
Fri Jul 31 07:06:16 PDT 2015 --  And no guarantee of extension. Bruce is under control for next year and team option for 17. I'll take that. https://twitter.com/MetsFamily/status/627117427554426880 …
Fri Jul 31 07:02:15 PDT 2015 --  You'd really think more #mets fans would be intrested in the win now approach. It's crazy how hesitant people are to go for it.
Fri Jul 31 07:01:43 PDT 2015 --  Get more when? Lucky we could get what's on the table for a guy recovering from TJ. When do you want to wait till? https://twitter.com/MetsFamily/status/627116465548869633 …

Fri Jul 31 06:50:18 PDT 2015 --  I'd probably run out a lineup of: Grandy Uribe Duda Bruce TdA Murph Conforto Tejada Maybe swap Uribe and TdA?
Fri Jul 31 06:46:28 PDT 2015 --  What're Wheelers stats this season? https://twitter.com/WeAreMetsNation/status/627112753627561984 …
Fri Jul 31 06:32:21 PDT 2015 --  Get the deal done I want Bruce in a #Mets uni before this big series this weekend.
Fri Jul 31 05:57:45 PDT 2015 --  If we got Chapman with Bruce I'd shit my pants. That'd take a haul though.
Thu Jul 30 22:48:52 PDT 2015 --  pic.twitter.com/q8PPvgEyH7
Thu Jul 30 12:55:59 PDT 2015 --  After this game Collins will fall on the sword and tomorrow he'll still be our manager.

Thu Jul 30 12:45:46 PDT 2015 --  Amazing that Niese was pulled after only 87 pitches and Familia not pulled after a 45 minute rain delay.
Thu Jul 30 11:46:02 PDT 2015 --  Dale Scott ya puss
Thu Jul 30 11:09:49 PDT 2015 --  Nice
Thu Jul 30 10:58:16 PDT 2015 --  Uribe has sick cleats. Great throw by Conforto too.
Thu Jul 30 10:33:33 PDT 2015 --  Damn @DAVIDprice14 has me blocked. I honestly have no clue why lol
Thu Jul 30 10:29:35 PDT 2015 --  This has to be the best Trade Deadline in baseball history with the magnitude of contracts and talent changing hands #TradeDeadline #2015
Thu Jul 30 10:21:15 PDT 2015 --  That Granderson has 16 home runs blows my mind but damn good work Black Jason Bay
Thu Jul 30 10:18:31 PDT 2015 --  2 offensive players?
Thu Jul 30 09:16:21 PDT 2015 --  Terry is a goddamn retard. Also how do you not notice your shortstop bawling his eyes out? Old ass man.
Thu Jul 30 08:51:39 PDT 2015 --  I know for sure we don't have Gomez right now https://twitter.com/Lets86it/status/626781806369574912 …
Thu Jul 30 08:50:50 PDT 2015 --  Yeah it'd be the first time that ever happened https://twitter.com/AdamRubinESPN/status/626781704452186112 …
Thu Jul 30 08:33:03 PDT 2015 --  If the #Mets don't make a deal for a serious bat than it'll be really hard to continue watching this team.
Thu Jul 30 08:29:04 PDT 2015 --  The Mets have this checklist of needs that have to be met for a trade to go down. The list includes 2 players and we don't want either.
Thu Jul 30 08:28:15 PDT 2015 --  Also I really don't give two shits about Flores.
Thu Jul 30 08:25:34 PDT 2015 --  If 9MM kept the mets from making the Gomez trade than this franchise really is in serious trouble. And the MLB needs to take notice
Thu Jul 30 08:10:25 PDT 2015 --  So Mets don't want a rental, yet $9M is wayyy too much salary. That's code for no deal by the deadline
Thu Jul 30 08:11:04 PDT 2015 --  Went from being the most optimistic about this team for the first time in years to feeling like a normal mets day. Probably wont make a move
Thu Jul 30 08:09:58 PDT 2015 --  The #Mets literally cut each name from the "big bat" list because either money, or having to play CF or some bullshit medical records.
Thu Jul 30 07:48:04 PDT 2015 --  Mets not being in on rentals means we're definitely getting a mediocre ass player. Yes!
Thu Jul 30 07:27:16 PDT 2015 --  What bothered me the most is Sandy straight up saying "it will not materialize". Like damn dude.
Thu Jul 30 07:19:28 PDT 2015 --  Rajai Davis would be the worst consolation prize ever
Wed Jul 29 22:34:39 PDT 2015 --  This has to change how other front offices view the #Mets doesn't it?
Wed Jul 29 22:28:39 PDT 2015 --  @The_GrassyNol Using the watergate suffix to describe a modern controversy??? How effing brilliant!!!!!
Wed Jul 29 22:27:52 PDT 2015 --  Also has anyone used #GomezGate? Idk if that's as clever to anyone else as it is to me.
Wed Jul 29 22:27:14 PDT 2015 --  Any other outfielders available that are controlled beyond 2015? That was a huge upside to the "trade".
Wed Jul 29 22:25:06 PDT 2015 --  Preach https://twitter.com/TeamThirstTrap/status/626624193812008960 …
Wed Jul 29 22:20:47 PDT 2015 --  There was a couple minutes there where being a #Mets fan was pretty alright.
Wed Jul 29 22:03:07 PDT 2015 --  This is a serious bummer lol
Wed Jul 29 20:00:10 PDT 2015 --  Fuck it get Cespedes
Wed Jul 29 19:57:44 PDT 2015 --  Unbelievable. What a mets fucking day.

Wed Jul 29 18:50:07 PDT 2015 --  Well put Gare
Wed Jul 29 18:47:35 PDT 2015 --  Never seen anything like this. #Mets SS Wilmer Flores is shown on TV, on the field, crying during play at being traded. Yet still playing.
Wed Jul 29 18:49:01 PDT 2015 --  ONLY THE METS COULD FUCK THIS UP SO SPECTACULARLY.
Wed Jul 29 18:49:04 PDT 2015 --  Yo if he doesn't get traded lmfaooo
Wed Jul 29 18:46:33 PDT 2015 --  Well that's tough to watch. Mets would fuck up one of the biggest moves they've made in the better part of a decade.
Wed Jul 29 18:39:14 PDT 2015 --  Yeah guess it really isn't TCs call.
Wed Jul 29 18:38:21 PDT 2015 --  Seriously what is Terry thinking? Confirmed or not you can't risk this.

Wed Jul 29 18:05:05 PDT 2015 --  Is this it for the deadline moves?
Wed Jul 29 17:58:22 PDT 2015 --  Fuck yes
Wed Jul 29 17:58:13 PDT 2015 --  Done deal. #Mets get Carlos Gomez, per @Joelsherman1
Wed Jul 29 17:58:06 PDT 2015 --  We got him!
Wed Jul 29 17:42:28 PDT 2015 --  ...Ok nobody tell the Brewers about that at bat
Wed Jul 29 16:58:58 PDT 2015 --  Carlos Gomez in meaningful September games...in New York...in Citi Field sounds sounds like a really really good time. #mets

Wed Jul 29 16:51:45 PDT 2015 --  Overdrive I like it. Get it done.
Wed Jul 29 16:32:45 PDT 2015 --  I'm pretty sure people are live tweeting their twitter timelines. The trade deadline rocks.
Wed Jul 29 16:21:49 PDT 2015 --  I'd take Upton in a second. Come on.

Tue Jul 28 18:37:58 PDT 2015 --  If Nats lose we're 1 game back. Please go out and get the huge bat that we need. I want to win this division
Tue Jul 28 07:49:35 PDT 2015 --  My hair is at a great length for headbanging
Mon Jul 27 22:37:51 PDT 2015 --  Still probably rather have CarGo over Reyes (Gonzalez not Gomez) but I'd be happy with any lol.

Sun Jul 26 12:49:40 PDT 2015 --  Fucking Terry refuses to guard the line. A single brings the runner to 3rd but no god forbid the Mets ever guard the line
Sun Jul 26 11:46:38 PDT 2015 --  Big AB early in Conforto's career
Sun Jul 26 11:12:21 PDT 2015 --  97 on the corner. deGrom is fun to watch.

Sat Jul 25 21:19:24 PDT 2015 --  Even though it was off a no one starting pitcher who was basically tossing meatballs. Still...that swing though.
Sat Jul 25 21:18:34 PDT 2015 --  Conforto's swing did look awesome today. I hope that's something we get to see regularly. #mets

Fri Jul 24 22:49:58 PDT 2015 --  #Mets doing anything intresting this time of night?
Fri Jul 24 15:58:30 PDT 2015 --  I really don't care about Montero. He'll probably be a solid MLB pitcher but he wasn't helping us today so I'll take the big league hitters.
Fri Jul 24 15:54:54 PDT 2015 --  Who the fuck is Gant? #seeya
Fri Jul 24 15:53:22 PDT 2015 --  Anything would be an upgrade with this roster so I'll take these .270 hitters.

Fri Jul 24 08:18:40 PDT 2015 --  Can now confirm, Michael Conforto is the 1000th player to join the New York #Mets.
Thu Jul 23 15:02:42 PDT 2015 --  So Sandy Alderson basically said today that the #Mets have money to burn but it's okay if they do nothing, and, uh, David Wright isn't dead.

Mon Jul 20 07:24:41 PDT 2015 --  I'm not looking to simply upgrade the offense. I'm looking for a difference maker. Those usually come at the price of your top prospects.

Thu May 07 13:50:14 PDT 2015 --  Of course that video the Cavs put out was making light of "domestic violence". The pussification of America continues you weenies.
Thu May 07 10:16:17 PDT 2015 --  TdA, Murph and Niese would have to bring back something halfway decent.
Thu May 07 10:15:17 PDT 2015 --  Gotta trade 1/2 out of Plawecki/TdA? Who goes? I'm leaning toward TdA but it's tough.

Thu May 07 07:20:50 PDT 2015 --  I hope that stupid Cavs spoof doesn't turn into some deep intellectual conversation about "the effects of beating woman".

Sun May 03 19:15:09 PDT 2015 --  Phil Abraham is a fantastic director. Dude kills whatever he works on. First two episodes of Daredevil were best of the series.
