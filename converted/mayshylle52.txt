Sat Aug 22 08:30:54 PDT 2015 --  Aaaaaaaaw thank you @Sports5PH for getting a special message from the #Gilas boys for us loved ones here at home. Much appreciated.
Sat Aug 22 09:29:09 PDT 2015 --  Coach Tab said they will start shortening the rotation midway through the Jones Cup. They're still playing 12 guys to start in Taiwan.
Sat Aug 22 09:27:52 PDT 2015 --  Next week's practice will be very interesting especially with an additional weapon available.Whatever it takes to get better!Go #Gilas!
Sat Aug 22 09:27:11 PDT 2015 --  Its not about the wins (though that would be great), its about this new line up working on chemistry and gaining international experience.
Sat Aug 22 09:26:01 PDT 2015 --  Our players learn bad habits in the PBA and suffer as a result in Fiba tournaments. Can't understand why the PBA can't use Fiba rules.
Sat Aug 22 09:25:03 PDT 2015 --  Despite some stars backing out we did well with what coach Baldwin had. Could have been different if Fajardo, Pingris, Lee, Chan were there.
Sat Aug 22 09:22:19 PDT 2015 --  Thanks to Sports5 for their coverage of the Gilas Pilipinas games. Players greeting their families was a nice touch. Typically Filipino.
