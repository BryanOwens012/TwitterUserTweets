Fri Aug 28 22:00:23 PDT 2015 --  Seconds after the Bowl Game loss I started calling for "The Tim Beckman Farewell Tour". Guess the soon to be fired Mike Thomas shortened it.
Thu Aug 27 21:11:06 PDT 2015 --  Haven't we already seen Fernando Rodney, just with the name Rafael Soriano on his jersey. #WeAreGood #ThoseGuysAren't #WeAreGood
Tue Aug 25 22:25:20 PDT 2015 --  No fun if you don't get at least a little bit nervous. Cubbies win 8-5. #WeAreGood
Tue Aug 25 19:55:50 PDT 2015 --  Kyle Schwarber-the best thing to ever come out Indiana University since......... Yeah, I got nuthin'.
Sun Aug 23 21:30:47 PDT 2015 --  19 wins in 23 games; Four 4-game sweeps; 6 game lead over the Giants; They are no longer kids-these Cubs are good, and for real. #WeAreGood
Sun Aug 23 21:20:36 PDT 2015 --  How many fantasy owners season's about to go the way of Jordy Nelson's knee. That's what you get for pickin' a Packer.
Thu Aug 20 21:48:58 PDT 2015 --  I've been kinda depressed, being a Bears fan and all. Then I saw the Redskins play. Suddenly, I feel marginally better. Thanks, Jay Gruden.
Mon Aug 17 19:47:18 PDT 2015 --  Absolutely typical frickin' Cardinal rally-a terrible throw on a nearly tailor-made double play ball with a lumbering dufus running to 1st.
Sun Aug 16 21:30:40 PDT 2015 --  Congrats to @JDayGolf for a well-deserved Major in today's PGA. The emotion and respect that Day displayed was great to see.
Sat Aug 15 20:37:51 PDT 2015 --  Holy crap on a cracker-15 out of 16 for the Cubbies. Meaningful baseball in August...who would've thunk it? #WeAreGood

Mon Aug 03 21:53:47 PDT 2015 --  Putting all 17 GOP candidates in the debate would be like putting Illini football in the NC Series-unnecessary but funny as Hell.
Thu Jul 30 21:30:50 PDT 2015 --  Leake to Giants. Come on, Theo, make a damn move-everyone above and below you have improved themselves. #NoMoreClaytonRichards

Fri Jul 10 15:59:48 PDT 2015 --  Rondon becoming a major liability in the Cubs bullpen. Can't play 1 run games with a late inning guy with no confidence.
Tue Jul 07 17:35:32 PDT 2015 --  We can only hope that the duck hanging out around the Cardinals dugout doesn't become the 2015 "Rally Squirrel". #GoCubsGo

Sun Jun 14 20:57:10 PDT 2015 --  Brian Schlitter- @Cubs player most likely to play Charles Manson in a Helter Skelter remake. Or else best @NHLBlackhawks playoff beard.
Mon Jun 08 22:49:34 PDT 2015 --  Neither @TCU_Baseball nor @TAMU deserve to lose this game. Instant classic if it ever ends.
Sun Jun 07 20:31:30 PDT 2015 --  Wow, @NBA fans, one poor shooting game by Steph and Dellavedova is a god. #HypeMachine
Sat Jun 06 20:39:56 PDT 2015 --  Wait for it....... There it is-Patrick Sharp just tripped the bus boy-2 more damn dumb minutes of penalty box time.

Mon May 25 20:27:10 PDT 2015 --  Amazing-Jeff Van Gundy just "heard lightning" outside the Honda Center in Houston.
Mon May 25 12:59:09 PDT 2015 --  Well, that sucked.
Tue May 12 19:16:32 PDT 2015 --  Thank you, Canadian-based teams, for your time in the NHL playoffs. Please accept these lovely parting gifts. #NoCanada

Fri May 01 21:26:27 PDT 2015 --  Blackhawks Hockey:Blow a 3 goal lead in minutes then hold on to a one goal lead for 20 minutes-cuz' easy would be no fun at all! #OneGoal
Thu Apr 30 19:44:13 PDT 2015 --  The Bulls could have gone the last 23 minutes and 37 seconds of the 2nd half without scoring and still have won tonight's game.
Mon Apr 27 21:33:18 PDT 2015 --  MLB needs to frag this Orioles-White Sox series; too much going on to make this anything but a dangerous risk.
Sun Apr 26 20:13:03 PDT 2015 --  For the money Max Scherzer is making he needs to shut his pie hole and learn how to bat w/out hurting himself. It's been done for 100+ years
Sun Apr 19 15:56:53 PDT 2015 --  Scott Darling: The new Kris Bryant. Tomorrow's Chi-Town sports talk will be classic Windy City over-reaction.
Mon Apr 13 20:26:38 PDT 2015 --  Burke Badenhop?? This is a made up name, right? Then again, the Reds also have a pitcher named "Jumbo" so WTH.
Sun Apr 12 15:44:36 PDT 2015 --  Now Faldo doubts that Tiger popped bone back in. Then again, he also said the hand has 20 bones (actually 27). #SnootyBrit
Sun Apr 12 15:11:28 PDT 2015 --  Faldo now trying to cover his arse from his "backup singers" remark. #SnootyBrit
Sat Apr 04 20:17:17 PDT 2015 --  As if this loss isn't tough enough for Kentucky, some of these kids will go to bed tonight worrying they'll be drafted by the Knicks.
Sat Apr 04 20:25:37 PDT 2015 --  At least Kentucky players can study for their finals now...
Sat Apr 04 20:17:55 PDT 2015 --  Hell's yeah, Badgers!!!

Fri Mar 27 19:33:26 PDT 2015 --  Based on 1 1/2 games I would say that NCAA has work to do to improve the Houston site for next year's Final Four. Layout completely blows.

Wed Feb 25 21:07:39 PST 2015 --  Woodbury on Gesell's dunk-"Damn, maybe I should try that!" Ginger has hops!!
Wed Feb 25 20:56:19 PST 2015 --  Gesell's dunk may be the highlight of my college hoops viewing season.
Wed Feb 25 20:53:21 PST 2015 --  Good presser by Groce. "Played hard but not good", and very direct about the 0 assist, 6 turnover performance by Starks.
Wed Feb 25 20:22:33 PST 2015 --  The Hell with can Jenny McCarthy and Fill-InThe-Blank Wahlberg have a baby. The question is does the world NEED the offspring of these two.

Mon Feb 16 17:33:36 PST 2015 --  Count me in as one person who won't miss @DickieV during the Duke-UNC game. I may actually be able to turn off the "Mute" button.
Sun Feb 15 19:50:17 PST 2015 --  "Oh good, Kanye's on. Time for a bathroom trip." Come on people, I know I wasn't the only one thinking this.

Sun Feb 08 17:57:02 PST 2015 --  Beck's speech as dull as his music. Weak category this year.
Sun Feb 08 13:07:43 PST 2015 --  That better be a Flagrant 2 in Iowa City. Didn't even go for the ball. Referees need to stop this now.
Sun Feb 08 13:04:14 PST 2015 --  Thank God the moron @dandakich isn't here. I'm sure he's alerted all Hawkeye opponents.

Mon Jan 19 18:02:19 PST 2015 --  Yeah, @dandakich is bad. And this guy was trying to be funny. Did I laugh? Yes. Probably shouldn't have, though. http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-iowa-trooper-espn-announcer-20150119-story.html?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=t.co …
Sun Jan 18 19:40:46 PST 2015 --  Just watched the BTN replay of the Iowa-osu game that I attended yesterday. Much less enjoyable with @dandakich yapping his jowls.
Thu Jan 08 21:03:38 PST 2015 --  Just when I thought that @dandakich was the future of bad college hoops broadcasts I had my first Bill Walton experience of the season.
Tue Jan 06 20:58:04 PST 2015 --  So who actually writes the Tweets for @DickieV-can't be him because they occasionally make sense?

Thu Oct 02 23:10:40 PDT 2014 --  Even more amazing than the Zona win is that Scooby Wright III made the biggest play. So 3 different Moms actually named their son Scooby???

Sat Aug 30 11:10:16 PDT 2014 --  When you hear BTN's Glen Mason say "That's what I would have done", it's hard to argue with his incredibly mediocre record of 123-121-1.
Wed Aug 13 20:46:56 PDT 2014 --  Nice move by Tiger to bow out of Ryder Cup consideration and not have to make Tom Watson be the guy who cut Tiger Woods". #addSteveStricker

Thu May 08 21:15:00 PDT 2014 --  According to Hawk, the Cubs, who are 11-21, will move to 12-19 on the season if they hold this lead. That's a helluva win!

Sat Apr 05 20:21:43 PDT 2014 --  Get a stop!!
Sat Apr 05 20:20:50 PDT 2014 --  Coach Cal should be kissing his players cuz' what they 're doing has very little to do with coaching.
Sat Apr 05 14:04:03 PDT 2014 --  Wow, Bruce Pearl AND Kelvin Sampson back coaching college hoops. Looks like Alford and Calipari no longer the biggest creeps around.
Thu Apr 03 20:33:23 PDT 2014 --  Dan Dakich sad that there is no NCAA assist and steals competition. He knows what he needs and what he needs is more Aaron Craft.
Thu Apr 03 20:31:28 PDT 2014 --  Ummm...you can't spell "Southern Methodist" without "NIT" either. Guess this line was gonna work no matter who won.

Sun Mar 30 14:36:45 PDT 2014 --  When two rebounders "just go at it" a stiff arm to the throat is usually a foul-dumbass!!

Thu Jan 24 20:20:45 PST 2013 --  Any chance Bill Walton will shut up anytime soon? Glad to see Big Bill's taking full advantage of the legalized weed in Cali.
Wed Jan 23 22:02:13 PST 2013 --  Twitter problems ruined my timing but it's definitely a "Da Bulz" kind of night. Marco Bellinelli becoming Mr. Clutch. Noah's hustle rocks
Wed Jan 23 21:46:57 PST 2013 --  So I have never had a problem tweeting until tonight. Had to download the App for Kindle & all is well. Appears to be a bit easier.
Wed Jan 23 20:33:47 PST 2013 --  Both Minnesota & Northwestern outscored by Burr Ridge, IL. Middle School 7th graders who scored 70 in 24 minutes in a regional final 2nite.
Wed Jan 23 20:16:41 PST 2013 --  Okay, phone is now tweeting. Slow as crap, but it's better than nothing.
Mon Jan 14 20:23:50 PST 2013 --  Don't remember the Bulls ever being this medicore (ie. Miami Heat) this late during their "virtual eight-peat".
Mon Jan 14 20:19:48 PST 2013 --  Atlanta Hawks set the bar pretty high for "Suck Performance of the Year"- only a Butler trip to the National Championship game can save them
Sun Jan 13 21:42:07 PST 2013 --  Damn,DJK may go to "Cali" & love it so much he won't come back. But then who would be left to talk cool & contribute nothing otherwise?
Tue Jan 08 16:56:47 PST 2013 --  I can neither deny or confirm rumors that I have been contacted about the Bears head coaching position-everyone else has.
Sun Jan 06 16:50:44 PST 2013 --  17-14 Minnesota over Northwestern @ halftime. Suddenly, the Vikings game is looking pretty exciting. Hmmm.....Can Joe Webb hoop it up?
Sun Jan 06 15:55:17 PST 2013 --  Man, I need a Joe Webb fix..........said no one, ever. Bring in Cousins, Redskins.
Sat Jan 05 19:38:59 PST 2013 --  No words can truly describe how badly this game sucks. The position of backup QB for the Vikings is open as of........Joe Webb's 1st pass.
Fri Jan 04 20:58:29 PST 2013 --  Tonight's game shows why BCS needs to be 8 teams. No way Florida at number three is better than Oregon or Texas A&M.
Wed Jan 02 21:52:02 PST 2013 --  As good as they are, and as good as they'll tell you they are, the mighty SEC is only 3-3 in bowl games. Just an observation.....

Tue Jan 01 12:10:05 PST 2013 --  Last time Northwestern won a bowl game Fred Flintstone was their fullback.
Tue Jan 01 12:05:35 PST 2013 --  Nebraska has more points in a half against the vaunted Georgia defense than they did the entire game vs. lowly 4-8 Big Ten Iowa.
Tue Jan 01 12:02:27 PST 2013 --  Herbstreit-"NIU doesn't really belong in game, but could beat FSU." WTF, Herby, just shut the hell up already!!!
Mon Dec 31 20:20:51 PST 2012 --  That should shut up some of the bitchin' about 3 SEC schools deserving a. BCS bid. What up, Kirk Herbstreit? Go NIU. Huskies!
Mon Dec 31 13:56:26 PST 2012 --  Bruce Pearl- shut the F up you cheating loser. ESPN sold it's soul hiring your sorry ass. Well, sold their soul again.

Mon Dec 31 13:38:52 PST 2012 --  Another year of Rex Ryan for the Jets? Not that I care, but why? Just hope they're on the Bears schedule.
Mon Dec 31 13:07:40 PST 2012 --  More good play in Big 10 basketball in one game (MSU vs. MN.) than in the entire Big 10 football season.
Mon Dec 31 12:13:58 PST 2012 --  Funny, I thought Devin Hester had already retired!!
Mon Dec 31 12:13:08 PST 2012 --  "Our main goal is to beat the Packers"- Things Lovie Smith wishes he had phrased a different way. 7-1 to 10-6 = Buh bye!
Sun Dec 30 17:32:12 PST 2012 --  Championship teams do not depend on their biggest rival to make the playoffs. Hear that, Lovie? Hear that, McKaskey family? Adios,Lovie

Tue Dec 18 21:30:14 PST 2012 --  Tebow headed to CFL & Montreal? Maybe he'll team up with DJK. What?.....OOPS! Never mind................

Sun Dec 16 13:11:38 PST 2012 --  Bears football once again re-defining the word "suck". Green Bay coach should be administered an EEG for fake punt call.

Thu Dec 13 22:36:27 PST 2012 --  Wow, Mark D'Antoni is quite the asshat. Time for Robin Yount to take him hunting.
Thu Dec 13 22:13:23 PST 2012 --  Marvin McNutt on SportsCenter- yeah, baby!!
Wed Dec 12 23:29:16 PST 2012 --  Okay,still not tired, but that was kind of fun.
Wed Dec 12 23:28:11 PST 2012 --  With all the conference realignments, will we soon be seeing the "Pile of Crap" conference, or may the"Left Hanging" league.
Wed Dec 12 23:25:18 PST 2012 --  I love Bruce Weber, but John Groce has been fun as hell to watch on the sidelines. Big 10 will slow down the Illini enthusiasm, though.
Wed Dec 12 23:22:28 PST 2012 --  Why cant Robin Yount take Soriano and Marmol hunting? Hey, accidents happen.
Wed Dec 12 23:20:33 PST 2012 --  Oh darn, the Heat lost a heartbreaker.........yeah, like anyone's posting that.
Wed Dec 12 23:19:21 PST 2012 --  No truth to the rumor that Greg Garmon ran into a small girl at the mall and fell down for a three yard loss. Goodbye ganja boy!
Wed Dec 12 23:13:58 PST 2012 --  Golden State Warriors now 15-7. Which of you lying bastards predicted that?
Wed Dec 12 23:12:42 PST 2012 --  Someone needs to tell @ Hawkize that the Viked extended Ponder's contract just to see if his head will explode!

Wed Dec 12 23:08:23 PST 2012 --  Is the Bama QB staying in college a surprise to anyone? Was there a hot rumor that Ricky Stanzi's job may be open?
Tue Dec 11 19:00:23 PST 2012 --  Illini sneak by Norfolk St, but PG Tracy Abrams can't keep going 0/5 from the line while game still in doubt.
Thu Dec 06 20:58:50 PST 2012 --  How bad is Big 10 football? Bad enough to get the same # of bids as the MAC, and not be a betting favorite in any game. Epic bad!
Sun Dec 02 18:43:18 PST 2012 --  Kansas State vs. Oregon will be like Madden 2013- the Over-Under should be huge. Was really looking forward to Minnesota vs. Baylor-Damn!
Sat Dec 01 19:53:39 PST 2012 --  Bo Pelini has that deer in the headlights look. At least the deer die quickly, Bo. Next time, SHOW UP!

Thu Nov 29 19:39:51 PST 2012 --  What will John Calipari's excuse be tonight? How about "Their coaching beat my talent".

Sun Nov 25 12:01:00 PST 2012 --  Penn State attendance down over 7000 per game since 2010. Nice to see that a few people in Happy Valley aren't Paterno apologists.
Sun Nov 25 11:51:58 PST 2012 --  Those stupid Bear fans Hawkize was referring to are smart enough to boo Kellen Davis after yet another drop of a catchable ball.

Sun Nov 18 20:03:31 PST 2012 --  Steelers should get a penalty every series for those butt-ass ugly uniforms.
Mon Nov 12 19:52:43 PST 2012 --  And on a completely different note, Tom Crean is full of shit. I can't stand listening to him. Start looking at cars in the players lot.
Mon Nov 12 19:50:10 PST 2012 --  Anyone else think Gruden's just making up names for blitz packages?
Sun Nov 11 21:00:56 PST 2012 --  At least 3 QB's go down with concussions. NBC didn't seem to expound much on the fact that Cutler's was on an illegal hit.
Sun Nov 11 10:52:42 PST 2012 --  Great catch by CBS to notice that Holiday flipped the ball out of his hands before the ball crossed the goal line. NFL replay people-OOPS!

Sat Nov 03 17:37:33 PDT 2012 --  You could sneeze and miss a touchdown in Oregon-USC game.
Sat Nov 03 17:35:28 PDT 2012 --  No prob-to qualify for a bowl game Hawkeyes just need to beat Purdue at home and then.............oh shit!
Sat Nov 03 17:25:41 PDT 2012 --  So the experts thought USC would need to score 50 points to beat Oregon.... looks like 50 won't even come close.
