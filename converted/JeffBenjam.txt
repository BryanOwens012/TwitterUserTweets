Fri Aug 28 10:04:14 PDT 2015 --  Just speculation: If we see 4K video, it’ll be limited to the 6s Plus, which in turn has an entry level of 32GB.

Tue Aug 25 19:36:08 PDT 2015 --  As much as I love the Note 5, this is clearly a critical design fault that should have been obvious in development.

Tue Aug 25 14:47:34 PDT 2015 --  Seems like it would have been so easy for Samsung to design its stylus in such a way that #pengate doesn’t happen.
Tue Aug 25 14:43:54 PDT 2015 --  Sigh @jasonhowell @philnickinson The Note 5 stylus is well and truly stuck. A visit to the ATT store is next. pic.twitter.com/csR7wNTweP
