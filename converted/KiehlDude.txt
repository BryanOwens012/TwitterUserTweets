Wed Aug 12 09:00:27 PDT 2015 --  That moment when you wake up and you try to use your mouthwash as toothpaste. Ugh.
Wed Aug 12 00:34:57 PDT 2015 --  When I ask "Who's up" on Snapchat, and I don't get a reply, but I see 8 people have viewed it, I expect a response! You ain't sneaky!!!
Wed Aug 12 00:19:54 PDT 2015 --  Colorado sure sounds nice right about now. Actually, anywhere out of Batesville for an extended amount of time sounds good about now as well
Wed Aug 12 00:16:05 PDT 2015 --  Yet, if you want someone to be honest about you, can you really blame them for their opinion? It's as if you were asking to start shit!
Wed Aug 12 00:14:59 PDT 2015 --  Actually, people who do TBH stuff pick the ones they'd respond to because it's good things. Nobody wants to hear bad things said about them!
Wed Aug 12 00:13:51 PDT 2015 --  Have you ever wanted to do a TBH but then back out because you're too blunt or because you really don't want to be honest to some people?
Wed Aug 12 00:12:03 PDT 2015 --  Actually, probably not. I'll end up getting distracted and shit. Ask me questions and I may just get back to you though!
Wed Aug 12 00:09:25 PDT 2015 --  I feel like the more I drink, the more honest tweets I'll end up producing about random things.
Wed Aug 12 00:05:53 PDT 2015 --  I was never like this in the Army. Now that I'm out, nothing gets me going like it used to.
Wed Aug 12 00:04:38 PDT 2015 --  I realize that I have no drive. I lack motivation. All I'm doing is going through the motions towards an end-result.
Mon Aug 10 17:30:08 PDT 2015 --  There's always someone who does something that makes you want to end up getting drunk by 8:00pm. You are successful in ruining my day.
Tue Aug 04 08:57:00 PDT 2015 --  And if I don't last, then I owe her my number. #WinWinSituation @RondaRousey
Tue Aug 04 08:52:49 PDT 2015 --  I've never been in a fight before, but if I can last more than 30 seconds in the ring with @RondaRousey then she owes me a date.

Sat Jul 11 09:51:08 PDT 2015 --  But holy shit. Ambien will kick your ass
Sat Jul 11 09:50:10 PDT 2015 --  Just to let you guys knows, I wasn't abusing drugs. I am prescribed Ambien through the VA as needed for sleep.
Sat Jul 11 00:37:57 PDT 2015 --  This shit is tough. It looks like everything in my room is swaying
Sat Jul 11 00:28:56 PDT 2015 --  Maybe drinking Pineapple juice and shells and cheeze will make the experience better?
Sat Jul 11 00:28:23 PDT 2015 --  Currently, my body is being sluggish. I want walk correctly without going from wall to wall
Sat Jul 11 00:27:51 PDT 2015 --  Currently doing an experiment with Ambien. Took one 10mg pill.
Fri Jul 10 23:22:20 PDT 2015 --  I don't need a therapist whenever my dad knows exactly what to say. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars, his fee is love.
Fri Jul 10 23:21:40 PDT 2015 --  If it wasn't for my dad, I don't know where I'd be. Either in a bad part of life or 6 feet under.
Fri Jul 10 22:06:22 PDT 2015 --  And I'm somewhat content.
Fri Jul 10 22:06:14 PDT 2015 --  Actually, that's kind of what I'm doing now. Sitting at the river. Listening to Thrice on repeat. But not drinking beer.
Fri Jul 10 22:05:13 PDT 2015 --  That honestly does it for me. Hell, I can make it easier and supply the beer and music. All you gotta do is pick me up
Fri Jul 10 22:04:22 PDT 2015 --  Come pick my ass up, drive around town or on the outskirts of town, throw some Thrice or some chill music on and have a couple of beers.
Fri Jul 10 22:03:41 PDT 2015 --  I'm a fairly simple man, to be honest.
Fri Jul 10 13:23:29 PDT 2015 --  Wake up. PlayStation. Shower. PlayStation. Brush teeth. PlayStation. Go to work. Drink beer. PlayStation. More beer. More PlayStation.
Thu Jul 09 23:33:35 PDT 2015 --  Or not. It's okay. The beer in my fridge and the Netflix on my PlayStation has my back. Who needs women, right? #InDenial
Thu Jul 09 23:32:54 PDT 2015 --  So glad I'm not closing tomorrow. I have Saturday through Monday off so make plans with me!
