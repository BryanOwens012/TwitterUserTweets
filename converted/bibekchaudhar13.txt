Sun Mar 29 11:10:30 PDT 2015 --  @MClarke23 well done on your win and wonderful ODI career. It's been a pleasure to watch you inspire on and off the field.
Sun Mar 29 11:08:26 PDT 2015 --  The last 3 years have been a complete test of @MClarke23 as a man, leader and cricketer. He has shown himself to be excellent as all three.
Sun Mar 29 10:59:29 PDT 2015 --  What a great performance by the Aussies. The best side in terms of execution of skill and balance. Played for each other, country and Phil
Sun Mar 29 05:22:24 PDT 2015 --  Wow what a win and I can't thank my team mates and my fiancé @CandyFalzon & IVY for all their support love you all!!! pic.twitter.com/Rj7CZeJaEa
