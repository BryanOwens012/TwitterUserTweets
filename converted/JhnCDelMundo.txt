Sat Aug 15 04:14:23 PDT 2015 --  You'll never know how to make it on your own
Sat Aug 15 04:14:17 PDT 2015 --  So we can start it all over again
Sat Aug 15 04:14:14 PDT 2015 --  And I will give you all my heart
Sat Aug 15 04:14:11 PDT 2015 --  That might fit, like this
Sat Aug 15 04:14:08 PDT 2015 --  And I can lend your broken parts
Sat Aug 15 04:14:04 PDT 2015 --  Everything you said to me
Sat Aug 15 04:14:01 PDT 2015 --  I might miss
Sat Aug 15 04:13:59 PDT 2015 --  Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
Sat Aug 15 04:13:53 PDT 2015 --  Like this, with a tight grip
Sat Aug 15 04:13:50 PDT 2015 --  If you're pretending from the start
Sat Aug 15 04:13:46 PDT 2015 --  And admit we regret it from the start
Sat Aug 15 04:13:44 PDT 2015 --  We can both remove the masks
Sat Aug 15 04:13:40 PDT 2015 --  Whether we're together or apart
Sat Aug 15 04:13:36 PDT 2015 --  I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Sat Aug 15 04:13:33 PDT 2015 --  And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
Sat Aug 15 04:13:30 PDT 2015 --  You know I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it
Sat Aug 15 04:13:27 PDT 2015 --  Can we stop this for a minute
Sat Aug 15 04:13:22 PDT 2015 --  If I can make all this pain go
Sat Aug 15 04:13:18 PDT 2015 --  And I know just what she'll say
Sat Aug 15 04:13:13 PDT 2015 --  Two days in the same clothes
Sat Aug 15 04:13:11 PDT 2015 --  Again we take the same road
Sat Aug 15 04:13:05 PDT 2015 --  So we can start it all over again
Sat Aug 15 04:13:02 PDT 2015 --  And I will give you all my heart
Sat Aug 15 04:12:58 PDT 2015 --  That might fit, like this
Sat Aug 15 04:12:55 PDT 2015 --  And I can lend your broken parts
Sat Aug 15 04:12:52 PDT 2015 --  Everything you said to me
Sat Aug 15 04:12:49 PDT 2015 --  I might miss

Sat Aug 15 04:12:39 PDT 2015 --  If you're pretending from the start
Sat Aug 15 04:12:35 PDT 2015 --  So can we do it all over again
Sat Aug 15 04:12:32 PDT 2015 --  And it's no joke to me
Sat Aug 15 04:12:29 PDT 2015 --  Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
Sat Aug 15 04:12:26 PDT 2015 --  Since she went solo
Sat Aug 15 04:12:22 PDT 2015 --  Now she's feeling so low
Sat Aug 15 04:12:19 PDT 2015 --  Bodies intertwined with her lips
Sat Aug 15 04:12:15 PDT 2015 --  Running over thoughts that made my feet hurt
Sat Aug 15 04:12:12 PDT 2015 --  Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Sat Aug 15 04:12:08 PDT 2015 --  Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Sat Aug 15 04:12:05 PDT 2015 --  Said I'd never leave her

Sat Aug 15 04:08:44 PDT 2015 --  And why does she give a damn about me?
Sat Aug 15 04:08:41 PDT 2015 --  How does she know who I am?
Sat Aug 15 04:08:38 PDT 2015 --  My lip starts to shake
Sat Aug 15 04:08:34 PDT 2015 --  This must be fake
Sat Aug 15 04:08:31 PDT 2015 --  She's walking over to me
Sat Aug 15 04:08:28 PDT 2015 --  Low and behold

Sat Aug 15 04:07:43 PDT 2015 --  And he doesn't give a damn about me
Sat Aug 15 04:07:39 PDT 2015 --  But he doesn't know who I am
Sat Aug 15 04:07:36 PDT 2015 --  And drives an Iroc
Sat Aug 15 04:07:33 PDT 2015 --  He lives on my block
Sat Aug 15 04:07:30 PDT 2015 --  My ass if he knew the truth
Sat Aug 15 04:07:26 PDT 2015 --  And he'd simply kick
