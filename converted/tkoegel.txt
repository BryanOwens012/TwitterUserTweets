Tue Nov 25 10:01:20 PST 2014 --  Thanks, @AlexPavlovic. I now think one could interpret Sandoval's "want to be a career Giant" as seeking a "blow me away with years" offer.
Wed Nov 12 13:04:28 PST 2014 --  Hey, @rivercats, nice WordPress Blog. Glad you are in @SFGiants family. But the SFGs have wone the WS EIGHT times now. Pls change header.
Mon Nov 05 22:40:17 PST 2012 --  Flying home to SFO, the city of Champions, on @virginamerica and watching #flybyebaby SF Giants Channel. GO #SFGIANTS!!
Wed Aug 24 16:35:29 PDT 2011 --  @extrabaggs That SJGiants lineup looks pretty good . . . too late to put them on CalTrain up to AT&T?
Mon Jun 13 13:54:19 PDT 2011 --  @extrabaggs Any book signings coming up? I couldn't make MoMos and your book would be a good Fathers' Day present for me?
Wed Jun 08 16:55:14 PDT 2011 --  @extrabaggs Your gamer says 10 Ks; box score sez 11.
Wed Apr 13 15:50:33 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn Hard to be clear in 140 chars: 1 juror talking to media said she didn't believe KHoskins? or 1 juror mentioned another juror?
Fri Apr 08 08:04:28 PDT 2011 --  @JulietMacur Ms. Macur, your work on this case is (by a long distance) the best reporting I have seen on it. Clear, well-written, thorough.
Thu Apr 07 14:59:38 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn That Ruby argument then seems irrelevant and designed to confuse; I presume the jury will see through it. Thanks for the reply.
Thu Apr 07 14:32:01 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn Am sure u are 2 busy 2 read this. But what does Ruby prove with the 2003 neg results? Bonds admits use of UNDETECTABLE 'roids!
Thu Apr 07 12:32:52 PDT 2011 --  @gwenknapp Any theory why Ruby would make the specious argument on testing? He must know feds will make your HGH point in final words.
Wed Apr 06 15:02:01 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn Thanks for the scoop. Most USDC judges will have juries delib on Friday because the jury can work while court does its work.
Wed Apr 06 10:42:58 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn Do we know if jury will deliberate on Friday or not?
Wed Apr 06 10:04:24 PDT 2011 --  @markfwespn Do we know if the jury will deliberate on Friday? Got to be a nightmare for the Giants if a verdict came down on Opening Day.
