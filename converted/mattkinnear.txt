Sat May 02 07:18:04 PDT 2015 --  Wow. Lyle Thompson uses his body, slips below defender Randall and fires underhand. He has 3G. Unreal play from him so far.

Fri May 01 12:49:01 PDT 2015 --  Quote from @UAlbanyLacrosse Scott Marr last night about great record, but lower SOS, RPI: "We’ll play anybody, any place, anywhere."
Fri May 01 12:40:38 PDT 2015 --  I think the possibility of a two-bid @AmericaEast is not unlikely. @StonyBrookMLax could dominate FOs and beat Albany; Albany get at-large
Fri May 01 12:30:37 PDT 2015 --  Night in a new town away from wife: Getting an early bite so I can watch lacrosse and work in the hotel all evening. #wildandcrazyguy
