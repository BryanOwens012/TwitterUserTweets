Wed Aug 12 19:49:28 PDT 2015 --  Cancer and positive we don't talk about that enough! At this rate just wake me when the season opener starts.. No wonder they talk is
Wed Aug 12 19:47:19 PDT 2015 --  "Headliners" we have no way of knowing what's going on the field!!! Also because all this stupidity is "NEWSWORTHY" so is the cure for

Wed Jul 29 22:45:17 PDT 2015 --  But because they do just about everything baseball wise on a shoestring budget, it's no wonder they can't get out of their own way.
Wed Jul 29 22:43:49 PDT 2015 --  The "mets" remind me of the "no frills" section at pathmark supermarket. With all due respect, Gomez wasn't the guy for them anyway

Wed Jul 22 14:16:36 PDT 2015 --  Here is because of #24
Wed Jul 22 14:16:17 PDT 2015 --  So a simple text/phone call to say welcome to the team is too demanding for the great Mamba, after all part of the reason these guys are
Wed Jul 22 14:12:44 PDT 2015 --  That we've been accustomed to.
Wed Jul 22 14:12:21 PDT 2015 --  Like it or not it's time to start looking at this Laker team into the future, and what can be done to attract and keep the kind of talent
Wed Jul 22 11:47:38 PDT 2015 --  These things more than you think. And I'm pretty sure in the back of their minds it matter.
Wed Jul 22 11:46:17 PDT 2015 --  Not sure what it means that Kobe hasn't yet reached out to Bass, Williams, or Hibbert but one thing is for certain, players look at

Thu Jul 09 08:35:24 PDT 2015 --  And that was before David West showed his willingness to take less. No one can nor should begrudge DeAndre Jordan for "changing" his mind
Thu Jul 09 08:33:03 PDT 2015 --  Or organization is fortunate to have a roster with one or two, it's like money in the bank. Just look at the Spurs, from to bottom

Sun Jul 05 07:27:54 PDT 2015 --  To get their money so naturally they want an environment that says they will at the very least be competitive if not more. If this offseason
Sun Jul 05 07:26:15 PDT 2015 --  Geography of where they play? It's time to get back to basics and start realizing why laker fans love their team, WINNING. Players are
Sun Jul 05 07:24:16 PDT 2015 --  The lure of Los Angeles and the "Hollywood"" lifestyle. When was the last time I champion was crowned based on the popularity or the

Sat Jul 04 09:27:32 PDT 2015 --  Can't wait to hear the spin on arguably one of the WORSE offseasons, in Laker history. So much for what you've "done" these guys today
Fri Jul 03 20:19:03 PDT 2015 --  Them to offer 2 max players next year. Problem is there is no guarantee they won't fail the KD sweepstakes as well.
Fri Jul 03 20:16:37 PDT 2015 --  At this point is it really hard to imagine the Lakers not planning this shut out, if for no other reason than the ability it gives
Thu Jul 02 19:47:33 PDT 2015 --  Conference is even better than we are.
Thu Jul 02 19:47:06 PDT 2015 --  And if we actually are shut out this year, that's probably another trip to the lottery. Especially since everyone else in western
Thu Jul 02 19:45:42 PDT 2015 --  Already built. Nothing worse than being used.. Business or not.
Thu Jul 02 19:44:58 PDT 2015 --  More the damage control and we don't need that what need is a star player whose going to be a part of this NOW not later on after it's
Thu Jul 02 19:43:20 PDT 2015 --  I want to believe in this second meeting between LA and the Lakers tonight, but I just can't get away from the idea of this being nothing
Wed Jul 01 21:50:00 PDT 2015 --  Shutout like this before.
Wed Jul 01 21:49:43 PDT 2015 --  I realize my team is only several years removed from our last championship.. 2010 to be exact, but this is crazy. We've almost never been
Wed Jul 01 21:45:44 PDT 2015 --  Winning basketball.
Wed Jul 01 21:45:28 PDT 2015 --  Even back in the 80's all that glamour and lifestyle didn't mean a thing if Magic, Worthy, Byron, weren't all a part of Showtime
Wed Jul 01 20:00:08 PDT 2015 --  Out loud, fix it because it's definitely broke right now. All this activity in our back yard and we can't close the deal? Seriously?
Wed Jul 01 19:58:25 PDT 2015 --  So what happens next year when KD is sitting there along with an even better free agent class! This is not finger pointing, but for crying
Wed Jul 01 19:56:38 PDT 2015 --  Guard for years to come. The is a nightmare for every Laker fan from Cali and across the country. I see it and I still can't believe it
Wed Jul 01 19:54:41 PDT 2015 --  Agent meeting because the players feel they are stuck in the dark ages, hard to believe after drafting what should be an allstar point

Wed Jul 01 12:54:02 PDT 2015 --  Is it an organization problem? Or is the culture really that bad? Either way it's time to start thinking about changing things soon!
Wed Jul 01 12:49:14 PDT 2015 --  Really frustrating to see an elite franchise like the Lakers, being shut out thus far in the free agent frenzy.
Wed Jul 01 10:05:43 PDT 2015 --  The culture and atmosphere of the team cannot be overlooked.
Wed Jul 01 10:05:09 PDT 2015 --  The 2016 free agent class is not far away, when lots of teams will have big money, at that point
Wed Jul 01 09:57:10 PDT 2015 --  Guys have to want to come to the Lakers, as well as for less money, if that's possible. But clearly it's not just about the money.
Wed Jul 01 09:55:37 PDT 2015 --  One thing is for certain with regards to my Lakers, the culture of the team definitely has to change, the Spurs have shown us that much.
Tue Jun 30 13:25:54 PDT 2015 --  I need to literally get on a plane and get to the restaurant where Mitch, Jim, and LA will be tonight. Whatever it takes!!!
Tue Jun 30 13:23:42 PDT 2015 --  This waiting for free agency is killing me ! I can taste something HUGE tonight, at this point sleep is secondary!
Mon Jun 29 21:13:48 PDT 2015 --  And the next question becomes.. Who's next?
Mon Jun 29 21:12:58 PDT 2015 --  Not to discount the Spurs, nor should we but I root and bleed for my team, and whether LA signs with us or not we will move forward..
Mon Jun 29 09:43:55 PDT 2015 --  How much better I'll feel crushing his title dreams over the next 4-5 years.. Yeah, now I feel better!
Mon Jun 29 09:42:40 PDT 2015 --  It kinda bothered me when Marc gasol decided he didn't want to be a Laker based on pau's experience, and then I realized
Wed Jun 24 20:00:43 PDT 2015 --  Look into the eyes of someone who truly is in love, and see what you've been missing.
Wed Jun 24 19:56:51 PDT 2015 --  Don't get in the way!
Wed Jun 24 19:56:26 PDT 2015 --  The NBA draft is tommrow and as a full fledged Laker 4 Life, the reset button is hit and the train is on the track..
Fri May 29 21:47:15 PDT 2015 --  Because they were exposed in this series, and now they have all summer to remember that fact as they attempt to recover from this disaster.
Fri May 29 21:43:59 PDT 2015 --  And just like that the Rangers season is over! It's time to get rid of the slow, the old, and the weak links on this team..
Fri May 29 17:47:35 PDT 2015 --  Game 7!!!!! Nuff said!
Fri May 22 19:16:29 PDT 2015 --  And they don't stop attacking until the game is over.
Fri May 22 19:15:39 PDT 2015 --  Rangers finally giving the Bolts a taste of their own medicine. But they better stay on their toes, this Tampa team has great speed
