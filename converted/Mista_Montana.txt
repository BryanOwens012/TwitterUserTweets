Sun Aug 23 17:42:15 PDT 2015 --  So many children of rich families have infiltrated the showbiz industry - including Hip Hop
Sun Aug 23 17:39:42 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana there's good underground indie music ...
Sun Aug 23 17:36:16 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana commercial hip hop is a bunch of castrato's now-a-dayze..things realer then ever globally and you'd never know commercially
Sun Aug 23 17:16:43 PDT 2015 --  The establishments that wanted Hip Hop censored and policed in the 80s/90s must laugh now when they see the idiotic "Hip Hop" radio plays
Sun Aug 23 15:47:49 PDT 2015 --  Who ever let Chief Keef near a recording studio man? It's like listening to a drunk tramp

Sat Aug 22 14:24:04 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana I want a Wu tang or gangstarr movie.

Thu Aug 20 16:09:05 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana ya its discouraging but the saga continues
Thu Aug 20 16:19:17 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana It seems within any genre of music they want to incorporate some pop in it to reach to the masses. Easy to digest
Thu Aug 20 16:21:39 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana same with most of today's mainstream R&B! A lot of what's on the radio today is watered down/blended genres of pop & rap smh

Fri Aug 21 16:39:12 PDT 2015 --  Only Hip Hop artists that were talented were allowed to make records back then and any artist that wasn't couldnt get a record deal
Fri Aug 21 16:19:10 PDT 2015 --  In the new NWA movie where was Eazy E's classic Dr Dre diss EP? That could have been tastefully used
Fri Aug 21 15:39:51 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana @mcrencpt they spent too much time on suge
Fri Aug 21 16:02:21 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana I'm still mad they used "Quiet On Tha Set" over "If It Ain't Ruff".
Fri Aug 21 16:09:20 PDT 2015 --  Accurate. RT @Mista_Montana: Mc Ren is forgotten in the new NWA movie and that's weak
Fri Aug 21 16:06:18 PDT 2015 --  We have interviewed Ren on several occasions and what he told us about the NWA era just doesn't fit with the movie
Fri Aug 21 16:05:09 PDT 2015 --  Mc Ren is forgotten in the new NWA movie and that's weak
Fri Aug 21 16:04:00 PDT 2015 --  The new NWA movie gives the impression that Ice Cube wrote all the songs for their albums but that's not true
Fri Aug 21 15:58:06 PDT 2015 --  I seem to recall Jerry Heller adamantly telling us that he had no input the in the NWA movie
Fri Aug 21 15:50:39 PDT 2015 --  Having had Jerry Heller on our show twice as a guest it was interesting to see how the NWA movie makers chose to cast the actor for him
Fri Aug 21 15:47:33 PDT 2015 --  The NWA movie surprised me - well-casted but the DJ Yella and Mc Ren roles were criminallly underplayed - especially Ren
Fri Aug 21 15:37:52 PDT 2015 --  Ice Cube's son put in a great performance though it has to be said
Fri Aug 21 15:35:52 PDT 2015 --  I enjoyed the NWA movie but was shocked at how they underplayed @mcrencpt character in the movie and his role in the group
Fri Aug 21 15:34:20 PDT 2015 --  Just been to seen the NWA movie - love how they portray AIDS as a cough
Thu Aug 20 16:16:42 PDT 2015 --  The Hip Hop on corporate radio in 2015 isn't even Hip Hop
Thu Aug 20 16:10:41 PDT 2015 --  The national radio stations play pop music and call it Hip Hop so their coroprate owners smile
Thu Aug 20 16:08:45 PDT 2015 --  Hip Hop is nothing like what the national stations play
Thu Aug 20 16:02:53 PDT 2015 --  Then they listen for 2 weeks tops & forget about it https://twitter.com/Mista_Montana/status/634499452565344260¬†‚Ä¶
Thu Aug 20 15:57:12 PDT 2015 --  Music's so free nowdays - months of an artists' work is a zippyshare click away
Thu Aug 20 15:49:07 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana well that will happen if the quality of the music is there. Now its about quantity over quality
Thu Aug 20 15:46:37 PDT 2015 --  I just hope enough people still buy physical copies of albums to make the artists' work worth it
Thu Aug 20 15:42:59 PDT 2015 --  The new generation of Hip Hop fans will have no Hip Hop in their house - it will all be on their PC or on Spotify
Thu Aug 20 15:41:10 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana lol,I read the shoutouts, who produced it and the feature artist. Helped me looked up if they featured or did other albums
Thu Aug 20 15:39:20 PDT 2015 --  Physical albums were dope - now Hip Hop is just a rar file waiting to be skimmed over
Thu Aug 20 15:36:22 PDT 2015 --  I used to read the liner notes of albums and study who the artists had shouted out
Thu Aug 20 15:34:38 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana mutha fuckin Montana and Menace!!!!! Salute FamüèæüèªüèΩ
Thu Aug 20 15:29:46 PDT 2015 --  @Mista_Montana true but the sound quality will be lacking. This generation not many care for the sound quality
Thu Aug 20 15:28:11 PDT 2015 --  Spotify makes it so you don't even have to download your favorite artist's album any more - you just click once on 'Add To Collection'
Thu Aug 20 15:23:27 PDT 2015 --  Its so easy to own music nowadays - I used to have to pay money to listen to my favourite artists' album
Thu Aug 20 15:22:13 PDT 2015 --  There will never be a new classic Hip Hop album as people don't listen to albums long enough any more - its so easy to own music
Thu Aug 20 15:19:58 PDT 2015 --  I often wonder why artists bother any more - 12 months of hard work just turns into a free download for the fans
Thu Aug 20 15:18:53 PDT 2015 --  Now albums are just a download click - people listen - move on to the next download click
Thu Aug 20 15:17:55 PDT 2015 --  Music albums used to be so sacred - holding a phyiscal copy was everything
