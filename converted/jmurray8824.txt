Thu Dec 13 16:20:48 PST 2012 --  Phillies prediction...fire sale in July 2013. You needed to go for it one more time Rub and you blew it. Had money to spend too. Frustrated
Thu Dec 13 13:42:38 PST 2012 --  Dodgers Nats Giants Cards Reds, all better than #phillies. How can they be content? Blew last chance. CBP will be empty in a year
Thu Dec 13 13:40:16 PST 2012 --  #philllies had 1-2 more years tops with this team. And they blew it big time this offseason. F grade for Amaro. The core ain't what it was
Thu Dec 13 13:38:38 PST 2012 --  How can #phillies think they are 'championship caliber' when you sign a 36 year old and a speedy outfielder with no home runs as a pro
Thu Dec 13 13:36:50 PST 2012 --  I am so disappointed no frustrated with the #phillies . I pay good money and for what? The window is officially closed on this team
