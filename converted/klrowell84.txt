Fri Apr 03 07:43:57 PDT 2015 --  On here I can say things with out either of them saying their opinion. I with my husband could agree with me on how frustrating this is.
Fri Apr 03 07:41:53 PDT 2015 --  I changed my list to equal $100. I just want to say that I say things on here because my husband has Facebook and grandma.
Fri Apr 03 07:39:53 PDT 2015 --  Grandma said yeah sure. I don't even know if tomorrow when she gets her hair cut if I'm going to be able to get make up or not.
Fri Apr 03 07:37:52 PDT 2015 --  Grandma said no. I asked can I get clothes with husbands card? What clothes? Grandma asked. I said a pair of jeans and a shirt.
Fri Apr 03 07:36:33 PDT 2015 --  She said I don't know don't want to have to be some wear. Then I asked her can I get my makeup while we are their?
Fri Apr 03 07:35:15 PDT 2015 --  A few dollars over $100. So clothes and make up. I asked grandma do you nothing we won't make it to hair at 1 after eating?
Fri Apr 03 07:33:53 PDT 2015 --  I have two list because at jc penny's you have to buy makeup at sephora. I have already knew what I was going to get.
Fri Apr 03 07:32:23 PDT 2015 --  We will go eat, then go to bank. Then go to store then go to jc penny's to return your slippers.
Fri Apr 03 07:31:12 PDT 2015 --  So this morning I woke up I'm getting ready. Then she tells me turn of events.
Fri Apr 03 07:29:35 PDT 2015 --  Then I asked my husband for money to spend from his card. He said yes.
Fri Apr 03 07:28:27 PDT 2015 --  Grandma said yes we only have $100 dollars to spend. I will get an hair appointment.ok I said.
Fri Apr 03 07:27:07 PDT 2015 --  Sense your off tomorrow do you want to go to jc penny's grandma? I have been stud up for two weeks now.
Thu Apr 02 08:54:38 PDT 2015 --  So I am hoping grandma knows I would like to go.
Thu Apr 02 08:53:50 PDT 2015 --  But have been stud up because grandma couldn't see. Let's just say I'm so ready to go already.
Thu Apr 02 08:51:39 PDT 2015 --  For two weeks I have been obsessing with what I'm going to get at the store. Because I was supposed to go for two weeks.
Sat Mar 28 21:23:09 PDT 2015 --  And I wish I had a friend to talk to about anything on my mind. Grandma is on my Facebook. And so is husband.
Sat Mar 28 21:19:48 PDT 2015 --  I don't work. I do not get any income. My husband holds the money and decides what do to with it.
Sat Mar 28 21:18:48 PDT 2015 --  If I had a car I could go where ever the @&$? I want Togo. I am a stay at home mom.
Sat Mar 28 21:17:13 PDT 2015 --  I like to go with grandma because she knows how to talk to me like an adult and not like an child.
Sat Mar 28 21:16:17 PDT 2015 --  And I don't have that husband to say I'll take y'all.
Sat Mar 28 21:15:16 PDT 2015 --  Hard when I have to depend on my grandma to take me where ever I would like to go.
Sat Mar 28 21:12:58 PDT 2015 --  Hard when I don't have money to pay for the things that I want when my friend takes me out.
Sat Mar 28 21:12:13 PDT 2015 --  I wish I had money, I wish I had a car, I wish I had a friend.
Fri Mar 27 07:30:39 PDT 2015 --  To day is Friday!!!!
