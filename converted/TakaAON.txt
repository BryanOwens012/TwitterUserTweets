Mon Dec 08 04:38:25 PST 2014 --  Takamina: However, we're a really big group. We can't gather together at all when we're talking, and there are many things we can't settle
Mon Dec 08 04:35:53 PST 2014 --  Takamina: Knowing how difficult the job is, yet knowing I have to entrust it to someone, is painful. I thought it would end with me
Mon Dec 08 04:34:17 PST 2014 --  Takamina: For this reason, I hate to pass the title of soukantoku to Yui, who I'm so close with.
Mon Dec 08 04:32:16 PST 2014 --  Takamina: Being the soukantoku is tiring. It's intense. I think the members near me know this too
Mon Dec 08 04:29:43 PST 2014 --  Takamina's full speech has been uploaded to @akb48matome http://akb48-matome.blog.jp/archives/51951405.html …

Mon Dec 08 04:40:47 PST 2014 --  Takamina: At times like that, we need a single voice to rally us, to say let's do it. Yui is a magnificent kouhai.
Mon Dec 08 04:43:42 PST 2014 --  Takamina: I know giving Yui this position will set back her dreams, so I'm troubled by this. But I also think she needs this chance
Mon Dec 08 04:42:31 PST 2014 --  Takamina: In truth, Yui is clumsy and awkward. But she really, really gives her all. Her dream is the same as mine, to solo debut
Mon Dec 08 04:44:25 PST 2014 --  Oh geez, look at me talk like she's graduating now. It's a year away LOL
Mon Dec 08 04:43:56 PST 2014 --  Also wondering if they'll continue bringing Takamina in to put up the anniversary strips...another thing I can't imagine without her..

Mon Dec 08 04:24:09 PST 2014 --  On a more important note, its going to be so very different for Takamina too... almost half of her life has been dedicated to AKB.
Mon Dec 08 04:22:06 PST 2014 --  It's going to be really different for them after she goes...enjins, rehearsals, lectures, support...
Mon Dec 08 04:17:54 PST 2014 --  たかみなさん、、卒業。 んー。なんか考えられないなぁ。。想像できない。 たかみなさんに会いたい。話したい。 今家で餃子食べてました。

Mon Dec 08 03:42:52 PST 2014 --  Not just yet lol..but this. RT @shindenshaotoko bye takamina.tbh akb without you seems much more weird to me than akb without acchan or yuko
Mon Dec 08 03:39:30 PST 2014 --  I love Yui to bits, but I'd imagine the process should be a more natural one, instead of shoving leadership onto her. That's damn big shoes.
Mon Dec 08 03:38:32 PST 2014 --  I'm a little ish about them 'announcing' a new soukantoku...
Mon Dec 08 03:36:28 PST 2014 --  The countdown clock to AKB48's 10th Anniversary, will also be counting down Takamina's graduation...It's apt I guess. pic.twitter.com/Ro6GbFKOxr
Mon Dec 08 03:35:19 PST 2014 --  The theatre is the only place I imagined Takamina announcing her graduation..and I guess the anniversary is the only time they're all there.

Mon Dec 08 03:29:52 PST 2014 --  But of course, if they're better off in AKB, then stay lol..but still
Mon Dec 08 03:29:37 PST 2014 --  Is it bad that I'm hoping the rest of no3b will graduate with her? It would be so fitting for them to leave together on the anniversary...
Mon Dec 08 03:26:30 PST 2014 --  Yui as soukantoku.... I thought they'd kinda do away with the position after Takamina left...
Mon Dec 08 03:26:00 PST 2014 --  I was expecting her to graduate on the 10th anniversary, but didn't expect her to announce it now!
Mon Dec 08 03:24:58 PST 2014 --  So my first reaction was..is this a prank? I still have the freaking mechaike special open on my other screen ;___;
Mon Dec 08 03:16:38 PST 2014 --  I can't imagine the day when no3b have graduated and AKB is having an anniversary show...how empty would that feel for me.
