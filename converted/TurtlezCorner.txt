Thu Aug 06 08:05:34 PDT 2015 --  But no lies though. It's pays to be the oldest sometimes. Like being the first to get a car and have no curfew. #freedom #donthate
Thu Aug 06 08:04:47 PDT 2015 --  Example: I wake up at 7am to drive my sister to school, M-F. My bro gets to sleep in. #hethemiddlechild #nobeautysleepforme
Thu Aug 06 08:03:26 PDT 2015 --  Being the oldest child is some bullshit! It's like being born to work. I'm always taking care of somebody. #borntowork #nochillzone
Thu Aug 06 08:01:25 PDT 2015 --  Is it bad that I got excited when I hit 600 followers? My sister is like 15 and had 1,500 followers. #dafuck

Mon Aug 03 22:19:01 PDT 2015 --  on top of that, we can't find it. So then I start thinking about the spiders revenge. This motherfucker is gonna kill me. #imtooyoungtodie
Mon Aug 03 22:16:20 PDT 2015 --  She went to hit it with her chancla, but the spider was in an awkward corner and instead of killing it, it fell on my floor! #nope #bye
Mon Aug 03 22:14:35 PDT 2015 --  I was about to go to sleep in my room when I saw a spider in the corner. I yelled to my mother to come and kill it, before it got me. #nope
