Thu Aug 13 23:47:00 PDT 2015 --  An #Aquarius is more sure of what they don�t want than what they do want.
Fri Aug 14 11:47:02 PDT 2015 --  #Aquarians will always hold off on something until they are entirely certain that the timing is right.

Wed Jul 01 10:45:59 PDT 2015 --  When an #Aquarius loves, they love strong. When they get upset, it's not random. Don't underestimate the reason behind their emotions.

Wed Jul 08 18:08:30 PDT 2015 --  Nigga, I never argue, I just explain why I?m right.
Wed Jul 08 09:38:29 PDT 2015 --  Girls who think they better than girls without kids, but still stuck doing the same lame shit, no moving up but turning up
Wed Jul 08 09:36:48 PDT 2015 --  Girls who think they own shit no don't stank, can't cover it up with perfume forever girrrl
Wed Jul 08 09:35:29 PDT 2015 --  Then get a boyfriend and you never see them again, home girl where you at doee?
Wed Jul 08 09:34:06 PDT 2015 --  Girls who always around when they ain't got a boyfriend, talking about home girls for life
Wed Jul 08 09:33:13 PDT 2015 --  Girls who change themselves based on how their boyfriend is, fit in to his scene rather than just staying themselves
Wed Jul 08 09:32:03 PDT 2015 --  Them girls who can't go too long without a boyfriend, giving out their heart like nada then wonder why it never lasts
Wed Jul 08 07:50:50 PDT 2015 --  So tired but appointment to see if I am more dilated today

Tue Jul 07 07:43:38 PDT 2015 --  " @GirlsOfAqua: You'll most likely always come back to an #Aquarius. Because they have good karma around them ALL the time." Explains alot
Mon Jul 06 15:00:08 PDT 2015 --  #Aquarius thought: "I've had to let a lot of things go for my own safety and well being. Doesn't mean I don't miss it."
