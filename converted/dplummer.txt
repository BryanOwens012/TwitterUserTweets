Thu Jul 15 09:44:55 PDT 2010 --  @wikileaks Thats excessively hyperbolic. The wars were started by lying politicians, and not exposed by inept and greedy mass media.
Thu Jul 15 09:20:27 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic Is MTG unique in its longevity for a trademarked competitive tabletop game? In 2030 I'll be in the matrix either way. #mtg
Thu Jul 15 09:16:19 PDT 2010 --  Card getting me most excited for M11? Crystal Ball. The flavor and innocuousness is so great! Guess I like filtering my draws. #mtg
Wed Jul 14 15:39:18 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic Yea, tokens would be nice. I've lost a round at nat. quals due to forgetting my 1st Elspeth went ultimate (binned a land)
Wed Jul 14 15:22:58 PDT 2010 --  @OldSpice When the zombie apocalypse comes, there will be Old Spice shortages. In light of this, is it possible to be a man w/o Old Spice?
Wed Jul 14 13:31:46 PDT 2010 --  @Hawzzy osht monoblue! (replace Remove Soul with Essense Scatter) Could use another Quest, and have Sleep somewhere in the 75 #mtg
Tue Jul 13 20:03:13 PDT 2010 --  If you haven't already, go to http://www.youtube.com/oldspice and watch @OldSpice literally change the internet for all time.
Tue Jul 13 16:11:50 PDT 2010 --  Magic 2011 is here this Friday, July 16. Release event at the Lynnwood store starting at 6pm. $30 entry. Sealed deck rules apply!
Tue Jul 13 15:49:19 PDT 2010 --  @Hawzzy Run into that problem often?
Tue Jul 13 14:51:58 PDT 2010 --  @Hawzzy whoa, Canada. Good luck up there.
Tue Jul 13 14:45:21 PDT 2010 --  @Hawzzy What legacy tournament? (not that I play)
Tue Jul 13 14:42:07 PDT 2010 --  @dailymtg Seems obv. the replacement effect puts the card OTB, does not cast it. It wasn't cast, it couldn't be kicked, so discard 3 cards.
Tue Jul 13 09:15:09 PDT 2010 --  @lunacite BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZNOZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Sun Jul 11 08:36:52 PDT 2010 --  ya, just placed a small order from channelfireball for the cards i'll use. except the primeval titan, which i'm hoping will drop in price
Sun Jul 11 07:51:29 PDT 2010 --  @JonLoucks Had 30 at Ernie's in Woodinville. M11 limited is kinda meh. Opening a pool of meh, compared to Rise, which was a pool of awesome.
Sat Jul 10 15:40:33 PDT 2010 --  @lunacite we're at ernie's. I'm 1-1, Dennis and Nate are 2-0. #mtg
Thu Jul 08 15:29:21 PDT 2010 --  @Smi77y uw: All is Dust, Ulamog/Emrakul / mythic: path & DoJ, possibly All is Dust too if they're more PW heavy
Thu Jul 08 14:55:55 PDT 2010 --  @JonLoucks you just tweeted your phone and address to the world. >< #BadIdea Good luck with the job hunt and grats on graduating!
Wed Jul 07 14:05:19 PDT 2010 --  its infuriatingly hard to concentrate and code when there's concrete drilling and metal sawing happening on the other side of the drywall
Wed Jul 07 11:43:34 PDT 2010 --  @jessehogie Combat damage can't be redirected to a planeswalker, only noncombat damage. See rules 306.6 and 306.7
Wed Jul 07 11:37:00 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic If the targeted creature would be able to attack either you or a pw you control, it must attack you, not the planeswalker.
Tue Jul 06 11:21:00 PDT 2010 --  #ebz I've gone to Fallen London! http://www.failbettergames.com/echobazaar
Mon Jul 05 12:27:21 PDT 2010 --  @mtgaaron So, I can't Lightning Bolt your PW, but I can Maelstrom Pulse it? Thats a confusing distinction.
Mon Jul 05 10:57:46 PDT 2010 --  @thepchapin The day you get your hoverboard is October 21, 2015. http://bit.ly/9TGGXp
Mon Jul 05 08:50:59 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic Completely overblown. Bunch of crazy people on the internet, to be expected.
Thu Jul 01 14:26:33 PDT 2010 --  @misterorange that articles deals more damage than there are atoms in the observable universe, yet is non-infinite. amazing.
Wed Jun 30 12:09:18 PDT 2010 --  @mtgaaron Are you saying all PTQs in the known future will be standard? What about Extended next spring? Mine & Bell will be legal, right?
Tue Jun 29 17:39:59 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie @lunacite I'm leaving now, will be 30 Mon late #edh
Mon Jun 28 13:30:39 PDT 2010 --  @NorrYtt while the slavedriver is a zombie, the Titan gets you your 2 zombies immediately, and has an awesome name and art. i love the titan
Mon Jun 28 11:02:13 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic Then Jace Beleren would rotate out. Sun Titan's bestest friend would leave him!
Sun Jun 27 12:35:27 PDT 2010 --  Sad :( 1-2 drop. Lost to naya. Good cascade in game 1 to package sealed that. Mull to 4 game 2. #ptqseattle

Sat Jun 26 14:16:24 PDT 2010 --  3-1, lost rnd 3 to UW, double mull to 5 is bad. Still in the game. #cgcseattle
Wed Jun 23 12:40:41 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie also, this wouldn't be happening if they didn't get breaks. one of them would probably be hospitalized
Wed Jun 23 12:40:10 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie this tennis thing is amazing. my coworkers and i had to look up tennis rules to figure out what was up
Wed Jun 23 12:39:11 PDT 2010 --  #ThingsIveDoneShorterThanThisTennisGame flown to Europe from WA
Tue Jun 22 12:41:08 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie #youmightbeanedhdbif you keep track of your life and counters in your head, basically forcing other players to do it for you
Tue Jun 22 10:30:54 PDT 2010 --  @thepchapin Because life is suffering.
Tue Jun 22 08:47:49 PDT 2010 --  @fivewithflores I find power without accountability and public disclosure scary. I know, not very imaginative, but rational.
Tue Jun 22 08:35:59 PDT 2010 --  @thepchapin "real"/"usable" would be concepts defined through scientific inquiry based on repeatable, measurable evidence
Tue Jun 22 08:29:46 PDT 2010 --  @thepchapin God and Chaos are both concepts. One of them is real, the other is not. That is the difference.
Fri Jun 18 20:32:24 PDT 2010 --  @depickett's only play vs goblins... didn't help :( http://twitgoo.com/147m9x
Wed Jun 16 13:34:03 PDT 2010 --  @Hawzzy Ha! I'm having a no hair week!
Sun Jun 13 18:24:32 PDT 2010 --  Just saw the new #karatekid. Excellent movie! Def. a great movie to see in theaters, China shots were beautiful.
Sat Jun 12 18:02:26 PDT 2010 --  Sucks. Went 4-2-1 drop w/mythic pws. NLB kicked my butt. #scgseattle

Thu Jun 03 16:01:03 PDT 2010 --  @gfraggle99 Heh ya that was the point. Its that bad :) #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 15:52:14 PDT 2010 --  If ~ was kicked, it costs (3) less to cast. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 15:10:09 PDT 2010 --  Exchange two target verbs on card(s) you control. #BadTemplates
Thu Jun 03 14:25:06 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic All creatures with Horsemanship lose Horsemanship and gain Flying. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 14:18:13 PDT 2010 --  Destroy target Plane. Gain life equal to the number of times the planeswalk dice has been rolled while on that plane. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 14:15:37 PDT 2010 --  {T}: Untap target permanent that has not been tapped this turn. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 14:11:25 PDT 2010 --  When ~ attacks, if it has attacked this turn, it gains haste. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 14:05:57 PDT 2010 --  Choose a permanent. That perm. loses a number of counters of your choice equal to the number of cards in an opponent's hand. #badtemplates
Thu Jun 03 11:00:51 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic I have not played it, and don't plan to, even though I'm a big Steam fan. Paper will get me by.
Thu Jun 03 10:33:31 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie totally mindblowing. like music visualizers, it just sucked me in and hypnotized me for 4 minutes
Thu Jun 03 09:45:33 PDT 2010 --  @ccgtradepost absolutely! its why I play the game, of course :)

Wed Jun 02 15:45:18 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie @mulldrifting I saw Prince of Persia last weekend, it was great. could have used more puzzles and dagger, but still watchable.
Wed Jun 02 15:19:45 PDT 2010 --  @maro254 you should write an awesome paragraph about your awesome Scars block game, then replace everything spoilerish with "Goblin" :D
Wed Jun 02 13:15:47 PDT 2010 --  RT @hawzzy http://bit.ly/bxNWTa
Tue Jun 01 16:02:33 PDT 2010 --  @mtgcolorpie EDH 6pm tonight @ crossroads, right?
Wed May 26 16:25:36 PDT 2010 --  @GatheringMagic ooo, those few new planeswalkers would be pretty awesome
Wed May 26 15:40:14 PDT 2010 --  @fivewithflores wtf? hello crazy people. Should have sanity checks on regulations like this every year. Clear the stupidity.
