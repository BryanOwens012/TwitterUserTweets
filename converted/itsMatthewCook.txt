Sun Aug 02 12:50:40 PDT 2015 --  Can't ask for a better debut from Daniel Norris unless he tossed a no-hitter by throwing axes.
Sun Aug 02 11:08:56 PDT 2015 --  Two on, nobody out -- two pitches later, the inning is over. Well done, Mr. Norris.

Tue Jul 28 19:26:13 PDT 2015 --  If the Tigers buy at this deadline, they'll lose more fans than if they sell, and that's not only sad, but ridiculous.
Tue Jul 28 19:21:08 PDT 2015 --  So that's five series losses in a row for the #Tigers, four to begin the second half.

Tue Jul 28 18:40:31 PDT 2015 --  IMO, if we buy or just stand pat, the franchise will be headed for several years of really bad baseball, like 2011-2013 Astros bad. #Tigers
Tue Jul 28 18:33:33 PDT 2015 --  Not embarrassed with the team's play necessarily, rather Ausmus' brutal managing and the indecisiveness of front office. #Tigers
Tue Jul 28 18:32:31 PDT 2015 --  have never been more disappointed and embarrassed to be #Tigers fan. That the front office is still considering buying is indefensible
Tue Jul 28 18:22:49 PDT 2015 --  It's interesting how you have a struggling team being repeatedly told that they're still in and going to be buyers...and then keep failing.
Tue Jul 28 18:10:05 PDT 2015 --  Benefit of good scouting: Rays knew what they were doing when they wanted Curt Casali from Tigers. No All-Star, but a catcher with power.

Thu Jul 23 14:31:52 PDT 2015 --  He was saving Wilson so that he could limit the eventual future damage to only one run...ok, nope, can't say it with straight face #Tigers
Thu Jul 23 14:28:45 PDT 2015 --  OK, RH batters have .989 career OPS vs. #Tigers Ian Krol, .918 this year. And Brad Ausmus lets him face two RH batters. Inexcusable. Again.

Fri Jun 05 20:12:46 PDT 2015 --  My optimism dies a little more every time Martinez, Cespedes, or Castellanos strikes out hacking at a pitch away and in the dirt.
Fri Jun 05 20:05:59 PDT 2015 --  Why does it feel like Cabrera is really hitting like .267 with 3 HR and 13 RBI's?

Thu May 28 19:39:23 PDT 2015 --  Well time to pencil in our gazillionth loss to the Angels in Anaheim. Angels could be, like, 3-27 and #tigers would still lose there.

Tue May 19 05:25:15 PDT 2015 --  Attention media: VMart HAS batted righty against righty before in his career. Did it as recently as 2011.... #Tigers #GetTheFactsStraight
Mon May 18 19:22:03 PDT 2015 --  If double plays = wins, we'd be unstoppable.
Mon May 18 19:13:44 PDT 2015 --  Many teams have their worst hitter at No. 9 and one of the best at No. 4... #Tigers worst BA is at No. 4 and best BA at No. 9.

Mon May 18 19:06:21 PDT 2015 --  VMart, meet the DL. It's OK. You'll come back stronger and better. Think Don Draper in California. Rebirth. #idliketobuytheworldacoke
Mon May 18 19:06:49 PDT 2015 --  If I hear one more person say "But victors not really injured"......
Mon May 18 19:03:27 PDT 2015 --  VMart needs to only hit right-handed, or remove himself from lineup #tigers
Mon May 18 19:02:42 PDT 2015 --  It is selfish. His presence in lineup is hurting the team. We took 2/3 from STL with him on bench. https://twitter.com/tim_goergen/status/600481337255006209 …
Mon May 18 18:56:46 PDT 2015 --  Hopefully Victor will strike out or put the ball in the air instead of GIDP. Notice how I'm not allowing for the possibility of a hit.
