Sun Aug 16 18:20:59 PDT 2015 --  If somebody doesn't issue you a Trust Marker ask them Why. If somebody does issue you a Trust Marker ask them why.
Sun Aug 16 11:03:27 PDT 2015 --  Many people are naive, trusting those who don't deserve trust - which is why every chat must be monitored for trust to keep you in control.
Sun Aug 16 09:28:42 PDT 2015 --  Are you willing to tell someone how they violated your trust during a chat? So the member can earn a future Trust Marker from you? #trust
Sat Aug 15 18:11:53 PDT 2015 --  There are millions of factors that determine whether you trust someone or not. You're probably not aware of most of them. Neither am I.
Sat Aug 15 16:45:46 PDT 2015 --  The proof is in the pudding: will this app help you develop higher quality relationships than on any other relationship app or on your own?
Sat Aug 15 12:04:06 PDT 2015 --  You give a Trust Marker during your chat. What's the person doing in between chats? Will you issue another Trust Marker on your next chat?
Fri Aug 14 18:19:50 PDT 2015 --  You want total control over trust. The only way to do that is to decide if you trust who you're chatting with on every conversation. #trust

Wed Aug 05 17:07:10 PDT 2015 --  What does trust mean to you? I could say the exact same thing to two people, but one person trusts and the other doesn't. #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 14:21:28 PDT 2015 --  This dating app is the real deal...no bullshit!!! #dating #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 14:17:38 PDT 2015 --  Your friend may not share the photos you want to see or may not want to meet up with you until the 20th or 30th Trust Marker. #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 14:09:10 PDT 2015 --  You may decide to stop issuing Trust Markers after the 10th one, be content sharing your photos and meeting up. That's OK, but.. #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 12:20:15 PDT 2015 --  Because I want you to feel comfortable, have fun, and feel the rush of controlling who you trust and don't trust on every conversation.
Sun Aug 02 12:13:55 PDT 2015 --  Your conversations are private. I only require you issue 10 Trust Markers in 10 separate chats before sharing photos. Why? #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 10:11:39 PDT 2015 --  After 10 Trust Markers are issued that member can start sharing photos with the member who earned the Trust Markers. Get some. #datingapp
Sun Aug 02 10:00:52 PDT 2015 --  Jen: "Steve, I'm sorry to hear you don't communicate with your Mom. What happened?" Steve issues Jen her 6th Trust Marker. #datingapp

Sun Aug 02 08:52:44 PDT 2015 --  Bob: Hi Jen, hey let's have 10 quick chats, and issue 10 Trust Markers to each other, so I can see a photo of your tits." Jen deletes Bob.
Sun Aug 02 08:17:39 PDT 2015 --  You decide not to issue a Trust Marker. The person asks, "why didn't you issue me a Trust Marker?" Do you give an honest answer or not?
Sun Aug 02 07:23:33 PDT 2015 --  Something just doesn't ring true in what you're hearing. Are you imagining it or is it a gut instinct you should trust? #datingapp
Sat Aug 01 08:05:23 PDT 2015 --  Would you take a bullet for anybody? Then why would you trust somebody on a dating app without knowing if they're trustworthy? #datingapp
Sat Aug 01 07:36:13 PDT 2015 --  After every conversation you have the option of either issuing a Trust Marker or not. You're in control. #trust #conversation
Sat Aug 01 07:11:03 PDT 2015 --  I guaranty that once you start using We'll Get To That you'll never use another dating app again. #dating #datingapp
Fri Jul 31 16:27:52 PDT 2015 --  Viewing profiles is a starting point. But to turn a profile into a quality relationship you want to monitor trust on every conversation.
Fri Jul 24 04:10:23 PDT 2015 --  Since your relationships on this app are based on trust , I'll bet you could have more discrete affairs on this app than on Ashley Madison.
Thu Jul 23 19:21:07 PDT 2015 --  Do you want your relationship app's foundation to be built on lies, betrayal, & deceit, or do you want it built on trust? Probably trust.
Thu Jul 23 04:48:59 PDT 2015 --  Everybody wants to rule the world. We can help with this app by helping you to rule your world.
Wed Jul 22 18:29:26 PDT 2015 --  This relationship app has what every other relationship app wished it had - a streamlined method to control every relationship you get into.
Wed Jul 22 18:20:08 PDT 2015 --  Which would you rather use: a relationship app that only sells sex or one that makes trust the key factor in developing relationships?
Tue Jul 21 15:53:03 PDT 2015 --  This picture shows you the future of mobile app dating, friendship, and relationship building. Trust. pic.twitter.com/10XUEAG7xa
Mon Jul 20 15:39:59 PDT 2015 --  I can break psychology down to two words: betrayal and trust.
Mon Jul 20 14:34:01 PDT 2015 --  The only thing that matters in a relationship is trust. If you have a best friend or are in a relationship would you be in it without trust?
Mon Jul 20 04:50:46 PDT 2015 --  Do you like relationship apps that use an algorithm to match you? I think you know who you're looking for better than I do. Let me know.
Sun Jul 19 13:58:52 PDT 2015 --  My mission with this app is to enable people to enjoy the highest quality conversations that lead to long term friendships and intimacy.
Sun Jul 19 10:36:03 PDT 2015 --  I just saw a Zoosk TV ad. Their slogan is "first comes like." But I disagree. First comes trust then like especially on relationship app.
Sun Jul 19 10:04:32 PDT 2015 --  By the way you'll still get laid using this app, but you'll do it with integrity. You do have integrity, right? Because some people don't.
Sun Jul 19 09:58:15 PDT 2015 --  Let me simplify this: You want to get laid? Use Ashley Madison. Do you want a relationship built on earned trust? Use We'll Get To That.
Sat Jul 18 20:25:57 PDT 2015 --  In God We Trust. Take it seriously. Three months before I met my wife I asked GOD, "be it your will, Lord, please put a woman in my life."
Sat Jul 18 18:58:36 PDT 2015 --  I just saw an eharmony commercial that pokes fun at two people who met in a gym. I met my wife in a gym, and we've been married 20 years!!!
Sat Jul 18 12:11:52 PDT 2015 --  Here's a little secret: Trust and betrayal are direct opposites. The more earned trust you get the less likely it is you'll be betrayed.
Sat Jul 18 10:18:43 PDT 2015 --  How do you earn Trust? You show a sincere interest in the person you're communicating with by asking questions about what he or she likes.
Sat Jul 18 08:26:20 PDT 2015 --  This app is free to use unlike Match and eharmony. You don't need their elaborate systems to meet people because Trust is all that matters.
Sat Jul 18 07:49:36 PDT 2015 --  So what do you think is the most important ingredient in a relationship? Trust. Without Trust you have nobody to rely on or confide in.
Fri Jul 17 18:31:36 PDT 2015 --  I saw a Match commercial. They don't want you to get laid too soon or get married too soon but they can't wait for your credit card number.
Fri Jul 17 17:34:25 PDT 2015 --  If you're married you'll use the app to make some great friends, but don't fall in love cause you'll have some splaining to do! Trust me.
Fri Jul 17 14:02:53 PDT 2015 --  If you care more about the content of your conversations more than what people look like then this is the right app for you to meet people.
Thu Jul 16 18:14:21 PDT 2015 --  Guys, how much trust do you think you'll earn by asking women for naked photos on your 1st chat? The 2nd? Or the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th?
Wed Jul 15 10:01:48 PDT 2015 --  Our app is free to use. You develop your own relationships based on earned trust on every conversation. Why would you pay to meet people?
Tue Jul 14 15:30:41 PDT 2015 --  Why would we try to match you with someone? What would make us think we know what you want better than you? That's egotistical, isn't it?
Sun Jul 12 14:15:03 PDT 2015 --  These are some big reasons why trust is earned on every conversation you'll have on the We'll Get To That App. https://twitter.com/viral_land/status/612163231835140096 …
Sun Jul 12 11:43:41 PDT 2015 --  How many times do we have to be betrayed before we realize that trust must be monitored on every conversation we have?
Sun Jul 12 10:34:51 PDT 2015 --  How many people could you trust with your life on a day to day basis?
Sat Jul 11 12:00:58 PDT 2015 --  How do you feel about controlling trust during every conversation you have?
Sat Jul 11 04:48:34 PDT 2015 --  Trust is more important than love because if you cheat on me one time even though I love you...our relationship is over.
Fri Jul 10 14:38:21 PDT 2015 --  Can you imagine what your life would be like if all your relationships were based on trust?
Wed Jul 08 04:10:49 PDT 2015 --  Women, what would you say is the most important quality you want in a relationship?
