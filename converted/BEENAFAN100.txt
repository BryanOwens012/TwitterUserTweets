Tue Aug 25 17:57:48 PDT 2015 --  Jela LITERALLY clocked Lauren. But props to Lauren for not passing out right there. #FightNight #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:51:02 PDT 2015 --  Jela is very aggressive and intimidating. She is starting to unravel. And I'm here for it. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:48:58 PDT 2015 --  Lauren should know better than that. Especially with 4 black girls in the house. Oh and filming a TV show. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:46:21 PDT 2015 --  I just can't with Lauren. Like I tried, but I CAN'T! #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:37:45 PDT 2015 --  Lauren has soooo much to say with the other girls and in the confessional. But when she is in Jela or twins face she is all calm. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:33:52 PDT 2015 --  There is to many girls and they are all too grown for only Jela to be the one cleaning. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:33:00 PDT 2015 --  Lauren can't even afford the strippers TBH! #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:32:18 PDT 2015 --  Hell if it wasn't for the @ClermontTwins and there parents there would be NO strippers anyway. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:29:55 PDT 2015 --  If it wasn't for @ClermontTwins & @JeLaminah I would be too annoyed to really watch the show. Lauren & Jas are #TeamTooMuch #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:27:45 PDT 2015 --  It's a stripper. Community property. Lauren keep calm. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:27:09 PDT 2015 --  The birthday turn up is REAL! Thanks @ClermontTwins for having a birthday while filming. Something different. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:24:24 PDT 2015 --  The @ClermontTwins birthday look is VERY runway Naomi... Campbell of course. #WERK #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:24:03 PDT 2015 --  Which bad girl died and made Jas & Lauren the deciding factors to what bad is? Not feeling that stuff AT ALL. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:22:55 PDT 2015 --  Tina more body? Really? That's the BEST you got?! HA! #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:21:12 PDT 2015 --  Sacrifice? Are they trying to join the illuminati? #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:19:54 PDT 2015 --  Drunk girls TRYING to carry another drunk girl... Not a good time. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:13:01 PDT 2015 --  Kat is kinda boring. But they shouldn't FORCE her to do anything. Especially cheat. That's wack as hell. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:11:19 PDT 2015 --  Lauren was already lame before. But it's just gets worse by the episode. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:10:22 PDT 2015 --  Kat hasn't acted like an idiot yet. So there is a problem? #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:09:29 PDT 2015 --  Kat woke up out of her episode long slumber to with a dream of her Girlfriend cheating... Not good. #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:06:35 PDT 2015 --  Jas wearing her waist trainer! I just... #Speechless #BGC14
Tue Aug 25 17:04:44 PDT 2015 --  Lauren is CLEARLY the trouble maker. And loves it. #BGC14
Mon Aug 24 17:59:17 PDT 2015 --  If Mimi just kept it ALL the time. She wouldn't have all these problems. And more people would like her. #LHHReunion #LHHATLReunion
Mon Aug 24 17:58:52 PDT 2015 --  Jessica does look nice at this reunion. And her clothes actually fit for the FIRST time. #LHHATLReunion
Mon Aug 24 17:56:29 PDT 2015 --  It's good that Joseline and Dime made up. They really had no need to fight. #LHHReunion
Mon Aug 24 14:09:36 PDT 2015 --  I feel bad that your getting all this backlash from the community. But as long as your telling the truth is all that matters. @Bourgie_Posh
Sat Aug 22 09:03:10 PDT 2015 --  üèΩRT @BEENAFAN100: Look at my Facebook post from 3 years ago! @EvelynLozada . pic.twitter.com/wEwSbHoMxr

Thu Aug 20 21:07:47 PDT 2015 --  Why am I so obsessed with @allyATL and her friend after seeing this recorded Ustream. I canttttt!

Tue Aug 18 18:00:14 PDT 2015 --  Jela said "It's nothing that a lil bit of prayer can't fix. I'm praying that b*tch up out this house". @JeLaminah AMEN! #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:58:59 PDT 2015 --  If Jas would have stayed cool with #TeamClerMinah she wouldn't have to worry about all this. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:58:07 PDT 2015 --  Nice that Mrs.Laura is TRYING to bring peace. But it will STILL be #TeamClerMinah vs. #TeamExtras #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:53:03 PDT 2015 --  Shannon was NOT trying to apologize. But because of Shannade she kept it cute. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:51:58 PDT 2015 --  If you go into something THINKING your not going to finished. You already failed. Gotta have a never quit mentality. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:50:56 PDT 2015 --  I think Kat staying out of stuff is MAYBE a good thing. She seems like the type that would DRAG these bishes. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:49:40 PDT 2015 --  Lauren has to properly deal with her brothers death. Hopefully she can heal over time. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:48:21 PDT 2015 --  Twins that are too close and need to find there own identity. Typical. What else is new? #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:47:15 PDT 2015 --  Jela comes off as VERY strong. Maybe too strong actually. She should soften up some. More vulnerability. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:45:57 PDT 2015 --  Jas is so pretty and seems like she CAN have a cool personality. Just she has deep issues she has to work out. But she is not alone. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:44:48 PDT 2015 --  No you see #TeamClerMinah on one couch and #TeamExtras on the other. @ClermontTwins @JeLaminah #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:43:51 PDT 2015 --  These girls need a therapist really. Not a life coach. But Mrs. Laura will do for now I guess. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:42:29 PDT 2015 --  The Twins & Jela were definitely bout it! Jas and her team need some work. But it didn't hear that from me. #TeamClerMinah #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:39:03 PDT 2015 --  Mhm. They sipped it and used it against her. https://twitter.com/CamillesLife/status/633799841282330624¬†‚Ä¶
Tue Aug 18 17:36:11 PDT 2015 --  The Twins & Jela CLOCKED Jas with her OWN tea. That's why you don't show your weakness to soon. #TeamClerMinah #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:33:52 PDT 2015 --  Oh Jela STAYS ready to fight. She RACED up those steps! #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:31:51 PDT 2015 --  #TeamClerMinah better come through with the Shakira realness. Hips don't lie! @ClermontTwins @JeLaminah #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:30:25 PDT 2015 --  If you looked as flawless as @ClermontTwins & @JeLaminah you wouldn't have a probably dancing around barely clothed. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:28:57 PDT 2015 --  Jela makes a lot of sense. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:23:41 PDT 2015 --  That was not cool. You put make up brushes on your FACE not your ASS! Ugh #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:22:47 PDT 2015 --  Poor Kat. She is already not here for these petty antics. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:21:28 PDT 2015 --  Everyone wants to be the STAR of the show. But not EVERYONE is the star of the show. Kk? #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:20:14 PDT 2015 --  Good the other girls know there place. Extras in the Twins & Jela show! #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:19:18 PDT 2015 --  #TeamClerMinah is STEPPING out. While the other girls are MISSING out. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:17:25 PDT 2015 --  The twins @ShannonJessie & @ShannadeJenee read for BLOOD! Without even trying. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:16:30 PDT 2015 --  I love how the twins step in for one another without even asking. A tag team without a tag! #BGC14
Mon Aug 17 11:00:13 PDT 2015 --  You down with #TeamCLERMINAH? Get more of these three on #BGC14 tomorrow at 8/7c. pic.twitter.com/It7QD5suue
Tue Aug 18 17:12:08 PDT 2015 --  The other four girls made the division. They keep grouping the Twins & Jela together. But they are the best. #TeamClerMinah #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:10:33 PDT 2015 --  Jela is soooo #Unbothered it's not even funny. No point in even trying to argue with her. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:09:25 PDT 2015 --  These girls get bored and pot stir. They need more activities besides drinking and fighting. Even though it is Bad Girls Club. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:08:12 PDT 2015 --  Jas is a VERY pretty girl. But in the words of Joseline "Get with the winning team hoe!" #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:06:45 PDT 2015 --  Not the biggest Jas fan... BUT it was very real of her to talk to the twins & Jela about her struggles with herself. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:04:42 PDT 2015 --  That limo/bus fight was a mess. But it happens all the time on here. #BGC14
Tue Aug 18 17:02:12 PDT 2015 --  It's #TwinsTuesday with @ShannonJessie & @ShannadeJenee tune in NOW! #BGC14

Sun Aug 02 19:00:07 PDT 2015 --  Shaunie needs to STOP acting new to this. Heck Miami was WAAYYY more turnt than LA. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:58:15 PDT 2015 --  Love Evelyn&Tami they RAN Miami. HOWEVER don't come to LA with the Draya bashing. They know the game and how this works. Do better. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:41:51 PDT 2015 --  Draya said "Can't be no worse than the people Jackie been bringing around for the past couple of years". HA #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:40:54 PDT 2015 --  Shaunie come on now your an OG you know how the show works. Don't act like what is going on? Come on now. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:38:21 PDT 2015 --  If it's ALL about the frupa/fupa comment. Then yes Draya said BUT Jackie brought it up at HER event oddly enough. That's all. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:32:25 PDT 2015 --  Dang Draya just SAYS whatever comes to her mind. Can't say she is trying to hard. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:29:03 PDT 2015 --  Angel looks more like a Shahs of Sunset cast member then #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:28:04 PDT 2015 --  Draya deserves to bring a REAL friend on the show! #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:23:53 PDT 2015 --  An episode of this show wouldn't be the same without bashing Draya. #BBWLA
Sun Aug 02 18:13:37 PDT 2015 --  CLEARLY they brought Mehgan in as an attempt to boost ratings but we the viewing public don't like trifling whack people #BBWLA
Thu Jul 30 14:34:55 PDT 2015 --  Season premiere is tonight at 10|9c! EVERYONE TUNE IN AND SUPPORT THE @WEtv FAMILY #LAHair #WETV pic.twitter.com/fDo108m91H
Sun Jul 26 19:04:18 PDT 2015 --  Folks are too sensitive. My stomach isn't flat & nothing Draya said offended me. If it offended you, then you have some insecurities #BBWLA
Sun Jul 26 19:03:08 PDT 2015 --  Draya has already said she has flaws and things she wouldn't want shown. It's not like she said she is perfect. #BBWLA
Sun Jul 26 19:00:16 PDT 2015 --  I was kinda rooting for Mehgan but Draya is so unbothered by her lol #BBWLA
Sun Jul 26 18:59:59 PDT 2015 --  Mehgan was going IN with those Google searched reads. Sorta like Claudia vs Nene. Only because she knew about her BEFORE the show. #BBWLA
Sun Jul 26 18:40:50 PDT 2015 --  Mehgan is really immature. She was on bgc and is still relatively young and it shows. Not ready for this show. #BBWLA
Sun Jul 26 18:38:35 PDT 2015 --  Mehgan's body is fine. On her season of bgc she talked about Andrea voice and Blondie body NOW she is in the same spot. #BBWLA
