Sun May 03 16:45:16 PDT 2015 --  At least all the Pittsburgh teams are showing solidarity with one another by losing in similar fashions.
Sun May 03 13:04:04 PDT 2015 --  Did I throw a chair because of this match. Yes. Yes I did. Luckily I don't have much of an arm.
Sun May 03 13:06:23 PDT 2015 --  Want soccer to catch on here? Win. A lot. Period. Don't just be watchable. Be relevant. In other words, STOP BLOWING GAMES IN THIS MANNER.
Sun May 03 13:06:59 PDT 2015 --  No way around this. Bad loss for the Riverhounds. But bad losses are better early in the season. Aren't they?
Sun May 03 13:03:49 PDT 2015 --  First official bad loss of the season. Not to say 'we told you so' but our preview called this a potential trap game for a reason.

Sun May 03 11:20:40 PDT 2015 --  Clearly, the Hounds, as a point of cosmic influence, just has to concede the first goal. No sense fighting it.
Sun May 03 11:14:00 PDT 2015 --  Really...
Sun May 03 10:43:58 PDT 2015 --  Dallman starting and Russell to the bench are the two noteworthy parts of the lineup.

Sat Apr 25 19:36:56 PDT 2015 --  Well... that was certainly something. Thankfully we have a couple more weeks to make sure we have enough smoke.
