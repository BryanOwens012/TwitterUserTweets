Fri Oct 28 09:47:45 PDT 2011 --  Snow tomorrow? Seriously?
Thu Oct 27 19:03:36 PDT 2011 --  @J_Solstice So many things right and wrong about that game at the same time.
Wed Oct 26 11:59:22 PDT 2011 --  Can't believe J.P. Losman is back in the #NFL. That's proof the Dolphins are playing for Andrew Luck.
