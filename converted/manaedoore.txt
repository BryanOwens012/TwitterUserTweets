Sun Jun 01 21:56:01 PDT 2014 --  Just remember while your all at home online cracking jokes about artists etc that Most of you have done NOTHING. NOTHING! With your lives.
Sun Jun 01 21:57:15 PDT 2014 --  Don't flex someone else's achievements. So many of you Internet kids quote the feats of others as if they were your own.
Sun Jun 01 22:31:43 PDT 2014 --  Someone who's music you love doing great should never be an excuse to be awful to others. That's my point I suppose.
Sun Jun 01 22:33:45 PDT 2014 --  Don't be cruel to one another. And learn to understand how much work it takes to achieve anything in life.
Mon Jun 02 09:47:11 PDT 2014 --  Leave @onedirection alone! God they barely got to be a normal teenager! And so when they act like one you blow up! For Gods sake grow up!
Mon Jun 02 09:43:14 PDT 2014 --  There under so much pressure and for 5 years they haven't made 1 mistake! Suddenly they make 1 single mistake and it's like WWA!

Mon Jun 02 07:01:15 PDT 2014 --  @JJJordynjones Jordyn Jones - Fancy (Cover) @IGGYAZALEA: http://youtu.be/JJn03xJ29Vs "
Sun Jun 01 22:42:37 PDT 2014 --  Success should be celebrated and not used as an excuse to be awful to others, especially when it's not even your own. That was my point.
Mon Jun 02 09:08:49 PDT 2014 --  1 month till I get to catch up with @fionadargan and @KevinahD at the NANS!! Let's hope we can fit everyone in the elevator this time!
