Wed Jun 04 13:33:56 PDT 2014 --  If Smalling and Jones played for #WestHam they wouldn't be anywhere near this WC squad. #England
Wed Jun 04 13:25:58 PDT 2014 --  Is it me, or is there little logic in playing guys that aren't even traveling to the WC? #England

Sun May 25 06:24:07 PDT 2014 --  Great Minds wins at 5/1 not 4/1, even more profit there, shame we missed the 7/1 it opened at last night. Well done if you were on :)

Sat May 03 06:12:14 PDT 2014 --  Doncaster relegated after Brum equalised 2-2 at Bolton in added time. Brum were two nil down with 1/4 hour to go. That's football!
