Wed Aug 26 21:49:23 PDT 2015 --  Looks like I have to use OBS for this. :(
Wed Aug 26 21:40:34 PDT 2015 --  Is it bad to just local record any run attempts I make...? orz
Wed Aug 26 21:39:59 PDT 2015 --  Also I want absolute quality for HD games which means 8Mbps but that means nobody on Twitch can possibly watch it.
Wed Aug 26 21:38:46 PDT 2015 --  Is it possible to overlay splits in GCHD? OBS' quality is sooo bad for HD capture. :(
Wed Aug 26 20:12:29 PDT 2015 --  ??? I have a video on my computer saved as Splatoon but it's actually iM@S How did that happen?

Wed Aug 26 18:00:22 PDT 2015 --  What's a game with a lot of copyright music that I can do a test stream of? Would iDOLM@STER 2 trigger anything bad on YouTube? Let's test.
Wed Aug 26 17:57:54 PDT 2015 --  The stream itself is nice but it took me too long to find... somehow.
Wed Aug 26 17:53:10 PDT 2015 --  Ooooh YouTube Gaming hides its "Live" tab if nothing is live. But then like... I didn't even know that a "Live" tab existed... :B
Wed Aug 26 17:51:54 PDT 2015 --  I don't like YouTube Gaming mostly because I can't figure out how to search for a game and find streams for it...

Wed Aug 12 09:12:57 PDT 2015 --  In one day, over a minute was cut from LA Any%. Amazing.
Wed Aug 12 09:10:32 PDT 2015 --  if u guys wanna see the ACE in LA now check this out, it's neat. There's now a faster LA Any% than map warping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-LpLl6R_k …

Tue Aug 11 22:14:54 PDT 2015 --  Link's Awakening Any% is now the fastest Any% of any Zelda game. Faster than A Link to the Past.
Tue Aug 11 22:10:24 PDT 2015 --  I went from no Any% time to 1st place to 4th place in the span of a few hours. What a day.
Tue Aug 11 22:08:52 PDT 2015 --  "ACE be crazy."

Tue Aug 11 18:55:12 PDT 2015 --  @mabdulra_ LADXでは宝箱を開けてからの成功率が、もしかすると1％もないかもしれないのでRTAで成功させるのは極めて難しくおすすめできないかもしれない・・・。 LAの方が簡単すぎるので。
Tue Aug 11 18:54:50 PDT 2015 --  こんにちは！僕はゼルダ伝説をＲＴＡするマッブです！夢島、大好き！よろしくおねがいします！

Tue Aug 11 18:11:44 PDT 2015 --  LADXのほうのACEは成功率めちゃくちゃ低いからRTAで出来るんかなぁ・・・(；´Д｀)

Tue Aug 11 18:04:30 PDT 2015 --  Tonight I get to sit back and watch the any% world burn. I love it.
Tue Aug 11 17:58:18 PDT 2015 --  @mabdulra_ 同じ Doghouse3 の宝箱です！！ ただしリセットされたりフリーズする確率が高いです。
Tue Aug 11 17:54:19 PDT 2015 --  @mabdulra_ LADXの方のACEのは、 File1: だちるねら Da Chi Ru Ne Ra File2: けばうげま Ke Ba U Ge Ma File3: げばどがげ Ge Ba Do Ga Ge ですが、宝箱を開けた時の状態が不安定で成功率がとても低いです
Tue Aug 11 17:45:08 PDT 2015 --  @hogehoge61 @pirohiko <3<3<3
Tue Aug 11 17:42:44 PDT 2015 --  Oh, a reason to run any% again? Yes, please.
