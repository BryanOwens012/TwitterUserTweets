Thu Sep 08 19:26:24 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller what, you mean the Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robots movie starring Wolverine?
Wed Sep 07 07:51:51 PDT 2011 --  Broke news of the Lokomotiv tragedy to Jonathan Toews. His eyes widened in disbelief & he said "This is the worst summer ever for hockey."
Wed Sep 07 07:43:29 PDT 2011 --  Hey @ESPN... an entire hockey team just died in a plane crash. Not newsworthy enough to mention on SportsCenter? "Worldwide leader" my ass.
Tue Sep 06 05:10:33 PDT 2011 --  I've blamed the NHL for many things, but blaming it for the VCR (Vancouver Cup Riot) is like blaming the saxophone for Kenny G.
Sun Sep 04 09:17:10 PDT 2011 --  @wingoz actually, the pro bowl's in January, so that's one Sunday where we won't be distracted.
Fri Sep 02 10:14:41 PDT 2011 --  @ESPNResearch what are the figures for the other sports? MLB, NBA, NCAAB, NHL?
Thu Sep 01 12:01:57 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller that's nothing, once saw an episode where the dad claimed that the baby wasn't his because the kid was short and he's tall!
Sun Aug 28 22:12:11 PDT 2011 --  @JimGaffigan what if the password's "password1?"
Tue Aug 23 15:47:29 PDT 2011 --  Obama golfing when earthquake hit. Ball on edge of cup rolled in, beating Judge Smails. Biden danced to "I'm All Right" as credits rolled.
Sat Aug 20 10:02:15 PDT 2011 --  @JJ_McCullough as he said on the Colbert Report, time vortexes are tricky like that. And what'd he say? Must've deleted it since then.
Fri Aug 19 15:53:54 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller No worries, least I could do. I know how aggravating working with them can be, so best of luck.
Fri Aug 19 15:39:11 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller do it sooner rather than later, believe me. They have their own slow pace/process for everything, but a rep could nudge 'em.
Fri Aug 19 15:35:30 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller can't guarantee that it will work, but having a rep office contacting the state dept/USCIS could expedite the process.
Fri Aug 19 15:34:03 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller I used to deal with visa issues when I interned in a U.S. Congressional office. Contact your rep about the issue.
Fri Aug 19 15:04:05 PDT 2011 --  @ESPNStatsInfo hey espn, did'ya forget that divisions didn't even freaking exist for a good 80-90 years of that? Crap stat much?
Thu Aug 18 14:25:32 PDT 2011 --  @JJ_McCullough harder to win one upset than 50+, I guess. One of the good things about our messed up process, maybe?

Fri Aug 12 11:22:21 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller you know what they say... socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor.
Fri Aug 12 11:01:38 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller because a lot of people still take the phrase "better dead than red" a bit too literally for our own good.

Sun Jul 24 20:29:50 PDT 2011 --  @neiltyson they had the gall to air the original version instead of the director's cut that you served as historical night sky advisor on?

Mon Jul 18 16:28:02 PDT 2011 --  @pbeazy just write what you'd ordinarily write, and then go back when you're done and replace all the swears with made-up nonsense words.
Sun Jul 17 18:52:03 PDT 2011 --  As if every religion wasn't a set of laws or guidelines on how to effectively live your life.
Sun Jul 17 18:50:47 PDT 2011 --  It strikes me as absurd the same group of people who want to display the Ten Commandments in courtrooms think that Islam is a set of laws.
Wed Jul 13 15:09:19 PDT 2011 --  We have paid each Congressman around $4000 per bill passed this year.

Tue Jul 12 20:02:38 PDT 2011 --  Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30mph, thrown at 45-deg angle. Any slower at any other angle hits ground.
Mon Jul 11 11:11:05 PDT 2011 --  @beatonna yes, it's phenomenally well done. Just steer away from the prequel and sequel the author's son had somebody ghostwrite for him.

Mon Apr 04 19:11:14 PDT 2011 --  Good way to end the half, #Butler! Go #Bulldogs! ... too low-scoring of a half to project anything, though.
Mon Apr 04 18:28:06 PDT 2011 --  I just realized the Michael Vick is probably really excited about this game... a husky fighting a bulldog...

Sun Mar 27 16:01:17 PDT 2011 --  @neiltyson So our brain is a galaxy of neuron stars? A universe of neuron galaxies?
Sun Mar 27 16:00:32 PDT 2011 --  Is it possible for #UNC and #Kentucky to lose today?
Sun Mar 27 13:44:17 PDT 2011 --  Highest seed numbers ever in the Final Four was a combined 22 in 2000. We will have at least 24 with UNC, and possibly 26 with UK. Amazing.
Sun Mar 27 13:45:40 PDT 2011 --  I'm not going to lie... as an #Illini fan, I'm feeling a great deal of glorious #schadenfreude right now.
Sun Mar 27 13:41:07 PDT 2011 --  I'm already looking forward to the #Butler vs #VCU Final Four matchup.
Sun Mar 27 12:25:35 PDT 2011 --  Really hoping that #VCU pulls out a win over #Kansas. Good first half, but they need a good second half, too.
Sat Mar 26 16:05:03 PDT 2011 --  #DePauw grads know how to win. 'nuff said.
Sat Mar 26 16:00:24 PDT 2011 --  Congrats #Butler!
Sat Mar 26 15:57:15 PDT 2011 --  The #ruleofgus is living up to its name.
Fri Mar 25 12:20:35 PDT 2011 --  @JJ_McCullough that's actually pretty cool.
Fri Mar 25 05:03:44 PDT 2011 --  If I'm counting correctly, I haven't been able to sleep for ten of the last fifteen nights. Not exactly an ideal stretch of #insomnia.
Fri Mar 25 04:25:24 PDT 2011 --  @catsinsider Awesome last minute win, guys! That was just an amazing finish.
Fri Mar 25 04:24:12 PDT 2011 --  Oh man, I'm tired as hell, but one helluva win by #Geelong over #St. Kilda!
Fri Mar 25 02:05:59 PDT 2011 --  Oh well, at least I can watch #Geelong while being stuck as an insomniac tonight... Go #Cats!
Thu Mar 24 18:45:20 PDT 2011 --  The #Butler / #Duke game's going to be fun.
Thu Mar 24 09:18:40 PDT 2011 --  . @KnowScott Is it normal for Earth to have so many quakes, you ask? Yup. Our planet has always worked hard to kill us all.
Wed Mar 23 20:03:16 PDT 2011 --  Keep it up, @NHLBlackhawks!
Wed Mar 23 05:12:58 PDT 2011 --  "Only" took about two hours...
Wed Mar 23 02:43:23 PDT 2011 --  103 updates for #Windows #Vista? Holy shit, this is going to take a while...
Wed Mar 23 01:30:03 PDT 2011 --  Oh, and look'it that... another night where I'm up late and still not able to fall asleep. My bouts of #insomnia need to go back to normal.
Wed Mar 23 01:21:50 PDT 2011 --  Oh well, hopefully I'll have a job next season and be able to afford to go to more than one game... #notwinning
Wed Mar 23 01:21:15 PDT 2011 --  I was hoping that I'd be able to buy #Blackhawks tickets to tonight's game versus the #Panthers, but can't spend that much w/out a job. :(
Wed Mar 23 01:13:54 PDT 2011 --  @wonderella I'm desperately trying not to remember.
Tue Mar 22 16:40:36 PDT 2011 --  @JJ_McCullough but elections give them something to actually talk about and a greater ability to sell papers, so it'll never happen.
Tue Mar 22 16:38:45 PDT 2011 --  @mariannemiller good luck, I used to deal w/ them all the time when I worked in a congress office, so I know how much of a pain they can be.
Tue Mar 22 15:54:21 PDT 2011 --  #Okamiden is pretty good so far. Nice and quirky like #Okami, but really makes me long for a console sequel.
Tue Mar 22 10:20:15 PDT 2011 --  Way to ruin one of the most exciting plays in #football. Apparently the #NFL is run by morons. RIP #kickoffs as we know them.
Tue Mar 22 09:42:09 PDT 2011 --  Just spent $50 on gas... damn...

Sun Mar 20 19:30:59 PDT 2011 --  #Blackhawks win! Now, let's win this one, #Illinois!
Sun Mar 20 17:18:18 PDT 2011 --  ... I don't know what else is. Can't even get Yotes fans for puck drops. Want to read more about them? http://sportvotes.wordpress.com/
Sun Mar 20 17:17:23 PDT 2011 --  The #Coyotes had a White Sox player and a#Blackhawks fan do the puck drop.... in #Glendale. If that's not a testament for their troubles...
Sun Mar 20 17:10:56 PDT 2011 --  Go #Blackhawks and #Illini!
Sat Mar 19 22:07:43 PDT 2011 --  Another good night of #MarchMadness #basketball. Looking for the end of the second round (play-ins don't count!) tomorrow.
Sat Mar 19 20:00:50 PDT 2011 --  Pfff... what kind of #supermoon gets defeated by #clouds?
Sat Mar 19 18:38:15 PDT 2011 --  Even in my joking fantasies, I'm discounting #Illinois' chances against #Kansas. Sorry, #Illini. :(
Sat Mar 19 18:34:27 PDT 2011 --  Screw my #bracket, I'm now pulling for #Butler and #Richmond face off in the Final Four. #Bulldogs vs #Spiders! #marchmadness
Sat Mar 19 18:24:09 PDT 2011 --  @WaddleandSilvy It went from ButLOL to LOL Pitt in the span of a second.
Sat Mar 19 18:23:40 PDT 2011 --  Great win, #Butler! Helluva end to the game!
Sat Mar 19 16:46:27 PDT 2011 --  @danieltosh how about the Canadian Bacon Tour, eh?
Sat Mar 19 05:53:17 PDT 2011 --  And then there were none: No perfect brackets remain for ESPN.com Tournament Challenge. 19 entries, out of 5.9 million, went 31-1.
Fri Mar 18 22:45:58 PDT 2011 --  Sure, it's just a lender, but damn happy to finally be back on a laptop! :D

Thu Mar 17 22:12:22 PDT 2011 --  Man, I'm old.
Thu Mar 17 21:26:48 PDT 2011 --  Not a bad start to #MarchMadness. Entertaining day and my #bracket went 14/16. Too bad I had L'ville going a bit further than I should've.
Thu Mar 17 18:06:59 PDT 2011 --  #Dowell has mad #fisticuffs.

Thu Mar 17 15:45:40 PDT 2011 --  Nice win #Spiders. Keeping my bracket decent after lol#Louisville (though I'm happy they lost). #Richmond vs #Morehead should be a fun game.
Thu Mar 17 13:12:12 PDT 2011 --  Only 4 games in, and 3 great endings! #Butler, #Morehead, & #Temple are why #MarchMadness is the best postseason in all of sports!
Thu Mar 17 13:04:03 PDT 2011 --  @SportsCenter but is there fighting in the war room? #strangelove
Thu Mar 17 12:55:47 PDT 2011 --  Sure, it messes up my bracket quite a bit, but very, very nice to see #Louisville fall. Go #Morehead!
Thu Mar 17 12:34:11 PDT 2011 --  The #Morehead chant makes me giggle a little on the inside. #maturity
Thu Mar 17 11:51:42 PDT 2011 --  Woooo! First great end to a game! Nice win, #Butler! Almost makes me sad that I decided to not be a #Bulldog.

Thu Mar 17 09:45:36 PDT 2011 --  Though I will be taking a break from hoops to hopefully watch the @NHLBlackhawks beat the Stars. Red > green even on the 17th on the ice.
Thu Mar 17 09:10:41 PDT 2011 --  March Madness begins! Now for 12-straight hours of basketball greatness! And that's just today. :D #winning

Wed Mar 16 06:31:11 PDT 2011 --  Yet another night of no sleep. That's now four of the past six nights. Something's definitely wrong now... maybe the lack of a laptop?

Sat Mar 12 00:46:28 PST 2011 --  Day 2 w/out a laptop: so far, so good. Still getting used to not being able to just dick around on the web, but no real complaints... yet.

Sat Feb 26 23:47:18 PST 2011 --  Dear #Cubs .... why the **** aren't the first week of spring training games on TV? You part-own CSN & have a contract with WGN, so.... WTF?

Tue Feb 22 10:54:24 PST 2011 --  @TeamCoco we can also hold our booze better than robots, aside from Keanu Reeves, I mean. That robot can throw 'em back like the chosen one.
