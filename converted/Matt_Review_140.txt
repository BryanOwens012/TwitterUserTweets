Wed Aug 19 11:11:27 PDT 2015 --  REVIEW: @GooglePlay Better layout required, hard to find 'free' apps. Also not as wide of a selection as Apple's app store. Overall, average
Sat Aug 15 10:41:46 PDT 2015 --  #REVIEW @SamsungMobile S-Health App - Great for tracking basic exercise. Can be used without location services but not as informative. 8/10
Sat Aug 15 10:26:49 PDT 2015 --  #REVIEW @SamsungMobile Galaxy S5 - Pioneering for its time, some great features. Let down a bit by @GooglePlay. S-Health app is a highlight!
Fri Aug 14 16:43:05 PDT 2015 --  #REVIEW @FootballManager Great game. Takes you deeper into the game than FIFA does. Addictive! May be slightly complicated for new users
Fri Aug 14 16:41:26 PDT 2015 --  #REVIEW @NetflixUK Overrated. Wide range of choice, but mainly made up of bargain bin films. Better for TV series. Needs to update quicker!
Fri Aug 14 03:32:07 PDT 2015 --  #REVIEW Social Networking without all the 'share if you care' spam. Something for everyone #Twitter #MyFirstTweet #MyFirstReview #Follow
