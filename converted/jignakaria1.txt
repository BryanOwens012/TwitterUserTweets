Fri Jul 24 05:16:53 PDT 2015 --  Sometimes, it's not the person you miss. It's the feelings and moments you had when you were with them.

Thu Jul 23 20:31:00 PDT 2015 --  Be happy. Be who you want to be. If others don't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody.

Wed Jul 22 07:17:05 PDT 2015 --  #Libra's are mostly straightforward. If they don't like you, then they will say it to your face.
