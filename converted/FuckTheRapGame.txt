Mon Aug 24 12:28:57 PDT 2015 --  My lower self makes me laugh so I still fucks with that nigga even if he has me fucked up sometimes
Mon Aug 24 08:49:27 PDT 2015 --  I ask that question to myself, I don't know what to do. Chin is rested in my hands, I feel like I'm on 42.

Mon Aug 24 04:58:33 PDT 2015 --  It is hard to come up with positive words for liars, cheaters, and stealers, but they do teach us valuable lessons
Mon Aug 24 04:57:16 PDT 2015 --  If anything, that's just fucking up my karma
Mon Aug 24 04:56:25 PDT 2015 --  I guess we all get the karmic retribution we deserve eventually, so who am I to place dehumanizing labels on people bc of their lifestyle?

Mon Aug 24 02:50:32 PDT 2015 --  The fact that we can make metaphors about shit pretty much proves that everything is everything
Mon Aug 24 02:48:38 PDT 2015 --  I hate referring to things as God or the Devil, but there's definitely a discernible difference between the energies we serve outchea
Mon Aug 24 02:46:36 PDT 2015 --  I just hope you're not paying your tithes to "the devil"
Mon Aug 24 02:44:56 PDT 2015 --  We all have dues to pay before the next door of opportunity opens for us
Mon Aug 24 02:26:54 PDT 2015 --  Sorry if I creep you out, I don't know how to be "normal" anymore
Mon Aug 24 02:24:19 PDT 2015 --  I show so much love that they don't think it's real, but what can I do when it's the only thing I feel?
Mon Aug 24 02:15:08 PDT 2015 --  Something's always missing though, I can never satisfy myself
Mon Aug 24 02:13:48 PDT 2015 --  I wish I wasn't so indecisive with my creativity so I can do something with these songs I've made
Mon Aug 24 02:08:23 PDT 2015 --  I can't avoid shitty circumstances, but I can smile through em all with a little help from my friend Mary Jane
Mon Aug 24 02:03:22 PDT 2015 --  Of course the universe would give me a traveling job and emotionally involved with a female at the same time. I can never have it easy lol
Mon Aug 24 01:58:40 PDT 2015 --  I might as well wait until the car ride to New Jersey to get this sleep in
Mon Aug 24 01:54:44 PDT 2015 --  Actually, I just can't fucking sleep so I do this for a living
Mon Aug 24 01:51:43 PDT 2015 --  And here I am again being a creep, staying up for hours just to watch her sleep
Mon Aug 24 01:44:30 PDT 2015 --  Our bodies will probably be stuck in this servitude to the man forever, but at least we can free our minds

Sat Aug 22 11:17:08 PDT 2015 --  I ain't shit man, a few abstract ideas just happen to exist in my head
Sat Aug 22 11:16:02 PDT 2015 --  I'm honored but I hate when people put me in a list of their favorite tweeters bc I don't like being ranked above/below others
Sat Aug 22 11:12:30 PDT 2015 --  If you RT/fav certain tweets of mine, I automatically love you off the strength of being able to relate to some of my realest feelings
Sat Aug 22 10:51:31 PDT 2015 --  My position on Twitter is the old man who should retire but is too stubborn to give up the game
Sat Aug 22 10:49:56 PDT 2015 --  I really have nothing else to say tho, nowadays I just babble on about shit
Sat Aug 22 10:46:46 PDT 2015 --  I love too many of yall to just leave this realm and never return tho
Sat Aug 22 10:45:04 PDT 2015 --  Actually I should just follow Amanda's footsteps and delete all forms of social media. It takes baby steps to get over an addiction tho
Sat Aug 22 10:43:11 PDT 2015 --  And if someone approaches me in conflict, I'll just ignore em
Sat Aug 22 10:41:23 PDT 2015 --  From now on, I'm just gonna stay in my bubble and tweet to myself until someone approaches me
Sat Aug 22 10:37:30 PDT 2015 --  We'll probably be sheep forever so you might as well find a spot in the farm to have fun in
Sat Aug 22 10:33:45 PDT 2015 --  Yeah that shit does scare tf out of me
Sat Aug 22 10:32:15 PDT 2015 --  When scripted realities get interpreted as being real and starts to write the narrative for real life
Sat Aug 22 10:26:35 PDT 2015 --  That's what scares me the most https://twitter.com/sobeewankenobi/status/635140183256510468 …

Sat Aug 22 10:12:38 PDT 2015 --  It's not THAT weird, it's just not a part of your regularly scheduled programming
Sat Aug 22 10:10:24 PDT 2015 --  I may get a little weird sometimes but that's what happens when you're not holding anything back anymore
Sat Aug 22 10:05:18 PDT 2015 --  Some people never bother to look past the surface while people like me automatically look through the surface
Sat Aug 22 10:02:23 PDT 2015 --  I still gotta survive in New Jersey next week, I can't be doing this shit lol
Sat Aug 22 10:00:57 PDT 2015 --  Gotta stop putting homeless people in my presence bc I'll give em all of my money without thinking twice about it
Sat Aug 22 09:58:12 PDT 2015 --  It's funny when I go off into a deep rant around people who usually only catch my goofy side
Sat Aug 22 09:54:41 PDT 2015 --  I'm rich in life, these paper coupons mean nothing to me. If you want em bad enough, you can have em
Sat Aug 22 09:51:46 PDT 2015 --  They say a rich man isn't the one who has the most, it's the one who wants the least
Sat Aug 22 09:48:14 PDT 2015 --  I love everything. I have enough, now it's my duty to show the universe how much I appreciate it's gifts

Sat Aug 22 09:31:32 PDT 2015 --  *watches TV for 30 secs* actually I can believe it lmao
Sat Aug 22 09:31:00 PDT 2015 --  I can't believe that some men have the audacity to think that they can just throw paper coupons at a woman and pull her
Sat Aug 22 09:27:00 PDT 2015 --  It's also funny to see when people who are used to getting anything by throwing money at it get declined. Most start to self-destruct
Sat Aug 22 09:22:06 PDT 2015 --  I hate when rich niggas get the impression that money can buy them everything just because most people will do anything for it
Sat Aug 22 09:20:14 PDT 2015 --  Actually I'm kinda proud that she declined the offer because I don't know many women that would nowadays
Sat Aug 22 09:12:17 PDT 2015 --  Some dude in the grocery store just offered Mando $10,000 to take her out on a date. I told her she was a dumbass for declining him lmao
Sat Aug 22 08:48:39 PDT 2015 --  Gotta have that quality https://twitter.com/idothisnmysleep/status/635112515920396289 …
Sat Aug 22 05:17:13 PDT 2015 --  It can get way deeper, I just say it in the simplest form or metaphorically
Sat Aug 22 04:48:04 PDT 2015 --  Everything is going as it should, we just have some fucked up variables in the algorithms rn
Sat Aug 22 04:27:54 PDT 2015 --  Life is just a constant battle between good & evil and most of the time I'm just sitting back watching em fight without being on either side
Sat Aug 22 03:47:57 PDT 2015 --  It's so hard to just "let it be" tho
Sat Aug 22 03:47:23 PDT 2015 --  Trying to create ways to explain the unexplainable is an easy way to stress yourself out
Sat Aug 22 03:16:37 PDT 2015 --  The only thing I have to lose is my life tbh, you could take that away and still catch all of this love tho
Sat Aug 22 03:13:21 PDT 2015 --  Sorry, I'm just randomly tweeting without actually thinking about what I'm tweeting. I wouldn't pay attention to me either
Sat Aug 22 03:12:12 PDT 2015 --  Who am I too look down on others because of the concepts that exist in our minds?
Sat Aug 22 03:10:58 PDT 2015 --  Sometimes playing the game is the only way to connect with people, so fuck acting all righteous and better than everyone
Sat Aug 22 03:05:53 PDT 2015 --  I'm never in the game, I just play it for the fuck of it sometimes so I won't be bored since most don't know anything outside of it
Sat Aug 22 03:02:35 PDT 2015 --  I see through the layers you try to cover up. The more you try to erase, the more appears underneath it all
Sat Aug 22 02:56:54 PDT 2015 --  Everyone's trying to improve their sense of fashion, not knowing that the real ones are only looking af their sense of passion
Sat Aug 22 02:54:25 PDT 2015 --  I'm in a relationship with life right now, she just makes life more enjoyable
Sat Aug 22 02:49:12 PDT 2015 --  They try to say it isn't real, but they just don't understand how we feel
Sat Aug 22 02:44:04 PDT 2015 --  I love her, I fuck her, but that's not my girl. Entitlement would just put limits on what we have
Sat Aug 22 02:32:47 PDT 2015 --  Maybe this insomnia is really becoming a problem, my body doesn't feel abnormal at all though
Sat Aug 22 02:21:53 PDT 2015 --  Just remember that light shines the brightest when darkness surrounds you
Fri Aug 21 19:18:28 PDT 2015 --  Being genuinely loved has to be the greatest feeling ever
Fri Aug 21 11:16:13 PDT 2015 --  When I die, I just wanna get thrown out in the woods and be eaten whole to repay nature for all of the consuming I done during my time here
Fri Aug 21 11:07:58 PDT 2015 --  I'm over here lookin at this dirt like "damn I'm sitting here worried about some bullshit when this is all I'm gonna be someday"
Fri Aug 21 11:04:26 PDT 2015 --  Looking at dirt becomes trippy af once I start thinking about all the particles of dead people/animals that could be in it
Fri Aug 21 11:01:31 PDT 2015 --  And he looked into his hands then stared into the sun and said, "I am made of light"
Fri Aug 21 10:54:43 PDT 2015 --  I vow to never leave the house without my little black notebook in my pocket
Fri Aug 21 10:51:43 PDT 2015 --  I'm realizing that this and music is tied for #1 in the things that give me life
Fri Aug 21 10:50:05 PDT 2015 --  I started writing again recently and I must say that I'm a dumbass for letting myself fall off.
Fri Aug 21 10:45:08 PDT 2015 --  I heard they're paying a pretty price for you to dehumanize yourself and your people
Fri Aug 21 10:41:01 PDT 2015 --  Poor humans selling their souls for the promise of riches
Fri Aug 21 10:35:07 PDT 2015 --  I see the troubles all of my friends go thru and thank the universe for the fact that I haven't had any kids yet

Thu Aug 20 15:37:20 PDT 2015 --  I'm glad that most people don't listen to me bc the thing I'm tryna tell y'all the most is to not follow any path that's not your own
Thu Aug 20 15:29:37 PDT 2015 --  The mainstream media is not here to benefit you, stop believing their news and supporting their artists
Thu Aug 20 15:25:50 PDT 2015 --  The revolution won't be televised or broadcasted on the radio bc they won't be here to tell us about it if we're really getting shit done
Thu Aug 20 15:18:19 PDT 2015 --  Why care about saving us when the devil has a spot for you in his palace?
Thu Aug 20 15:12:22 PDT 2015 --  Sorry to say it but most of these celebrities y'all idolize have traded their souls for the spotlight and are here to lead you into darkness
Thu Aug 20 15:09:10 PDT 2015 --  They usually have a big enough following to really make a difference but choose to do otherwise to pay their dues to the man
Thu Aug 20 15:05:27 PDT 2015 --  There's a few of us who know the Truth but choose to push ignorance to keep the masses crippled

Wed Aug 19 18:50:05 PDT 2015 --  I'm puzzled by everything... What the fuck is really going on with us?!

Wed Aug 12 05:37:23 PDT 2015 --  I'm skeptical of Bernie Sanders because he sounds too good to be true lol. Trusting politicians ain't in my blood anymore
Wed Aug 12 05:19:53 PDT 2015 --  S/O to my FC/Noke fam for always showing me a good time whenever I'm at home. The Old Crow show was dope as fuck last night

Tue Aug 11 10:55:55 PDT 2015 --  I just sit back and peep game then playfully act ignorant because you'll drive yourself crazy if you take any of it seriously
Tue Aug 11 10:13:21 PDT 2015 --  But honestly, you should be good without it. If not then you will continue to get dragged thru the mud when shit hits the fan
Tue Aug 11 10:10:02 PDT 2015 --  Too many people get caught up in the allure of romance and fall for anything just to have it in their lives

Tue Aug 11 09:42:55 PDT 2015 --  My higher self doesn't need drugs But I still do hella drugs
Tue Aug 11 09:51:56 PDT 2015 --  It's 2015 and people still concern themselves with celebrity drama. When will we stop being distracted by the puppet show?

Tue Aug 11 01:10:10 PDT 2015 --  This physical world of course does look solid and separate so its to be expected that sense would be exploited.
Tue Aug 11 00:59:02 PDT 2015 --  Maybe we should all just shut up and enjoy the ride. None of us will ever know until we get there

Mon Aug 10 06:42:05 PDT 2015 --  It's kinda hard for me to be engaged in life unless I'm creating or experiencing new things.

Sun Aug 09 21:17:52 PDT 2015 --  I never imagined that Twitter got that deep until I witnessed it lol
Sun Aug 09 21:15:53 PDT 2015 --  The funniest thing about Twitter to me is the little cliques that have group chats to talk shit about other people on Twitter
Sun Aug 09 20:48:57 PDT 2015 --  These fuckin Phish tickets are making me think about the future too much. I need to get my shit together and be more present in the moment

Sun Aug 09 15:37:09 PDT 2015 --  I'll accept any labels placed on me. If anything you're just making yourself miss out on the whole me because I'm everything anyway
Sun Aug 09 15:33:40 PDT 2015 --  They'll call you crazy and weird when you're not afraid to be yourself
Sun Aug 09 15:29:03 PDT 2015 --  If you can't impress people with who you are then they're not even worth your time. At the end of it all, you will just be used & abused

Sun Aug 09 12:43:46 PDT 2015 --  I'm such a cornball when it comes to women sometimes, but that's how I usually know I'm feeling someone
Sun Aug 09 12:42:04 PDT 2015 --  I can't wait to be home in a few hours so I can give Mando some of this love I've been storing for her this week
Sun Aug 09 11:39:24 PDT 2015 --  Most people fear the lack of money and the lack of attention, I just laugh at both because everything's temporary

Sun Aug 09 11:17:00 PDT 2015 --  Your outer shell will never amount to the beauty of the universe within you, so stop being self conscious and become aware of self
Sun Aug 09 11:13:27 PDT 2015 --  I can't even tell myself when to piss or shit, it just happens, so what makes me think that I can control anyone else?

Sun Aug 09 08:37:55 PDT 2015 --  Getting rid of -isms and -archies, just to watch other ones develop
Sun Aug 09 08:35:43 PDT 2015 --  I'm really not trying to be cynical, I'm just noticing patterns

Sun Aug 09 08:19:21 PDT 2015 --  I'm becoming one with the fact that the world is meant to be the way it is today. It's just up to me to adapt without losing my morals
Sun Aug 09 08:14:19 PDT 2015 --  Planting seeds of love, hoping they blossom into flowers of joy
Sun Aug 09 00:38:47 PDT 2015 --  (This is just a rhetorical question. Trust me I know the logical answer to it lol)
Sun Aug 09 00:35:34 PDT 2015 --  What's the point of even talking/writing/thinking?
Sun Aug 09 00:33:14 PDT 2015 --  The best things in life can't even be accurately explained with our shitty ass words

Fri Aug 07 12:24:21 PDT 2015 --  Let's continue to fight over the fact that we're different expressions of the universe bc that's what humans do best
Fri Aug 07 12:05:05 PDT 2015 --  I didn't know what any of that shit was until someone placed a label on me and told me to go along with it
Fri Aug 07 12:04:10 PDT 2015 --  Why act like my country or race is superior to someone else's just because I was born under those conditions?
Fri Aug 07 11:58:40 PDT 2015 --  They tell me to take pride in shit like being American or being black, but it's not like I chose to be either of those things

Fri Aug 07 07:17:26 PDT 2015 --  Your taste for high end fashion just shows how insecure you are with yourself. It's sad that name brands validate your existence
Fri Aug 07 07:11:44 PDT 2015 --  Stop trying to hold on and just let things come and go as they please. The attachment is ruining you
Fri Aug 07 07:07:50 PDT 2015 --  Once you stop giving a fuck about losing shit, you really have no choice but to win
Fri Aug 07 07:00:43 PDT 2015 --  It's crazy how things fall into place when you least expect it
Fri Aug 07 07:00:09 PDT 2015 --  For years, I've been stopping myself from falling too hard for women, but something feels so right about this.
Fri Aug 07 06:54:47 PDT 2015 --  I love the feeling of being involved with someone but still having freedom to do what I want. A strong connection with no strings attached

Thu Aug 06 07:54:59 PDT 2015 --  I mean everything comes from the same source, so how can you compare its importance or value?

Sat Jul 18 07:13:27 PDT 2015 --  Say what u want about my presence on Twitter but no one that knows me irl can say I've done them wrong so I'll always have that going for me
Sat Jul 18 07:03:57 PDT 2015 --  They call themselves awakened, but still fight over beliefs like the people they claim to have ascended past
Sat Jul 18 06:59:59 PDT 2015 --  You could even shoot me and I'd find a way to forgive you for it eventually
Sat Jul 18 06:56:17 PDT 2015 --  If I cared about it then that would be placing a condition on my love which would make me a liar

Sat Jul 18 06:34:15 PDT 2015 --  We can get in a heated debate and talk shit to each other all day long but you'll never see me get salty and take things personal
Sat Jul 18 06:31:34 PDT 2015 --  Some people think you're hateful and close minded just because you have one disagreement with them and that shit's annoying af
Sat Jul 18 06:29:41 PDT 2015 --  I can be loving and accepting and still have my own opinions on things. Like who tf would I be without my own voice?

Fri Jul 17 07:12:57 PDT 2015 --  Kinda hard to get mad over symbols when you realize that you can make em mean whatever you want them to mean
Fri Jul 17 06:57:37 PDT 2015 --  That shit kinda bothers me, but all I can do is pray for yall and hope that you can see the light someday lol
Fri Jul 17 06:56:02 PDT 2015 --  I used to think yall were just trolling by saying future is the best rapper in the game rn, but so many people seriously feel that way

Thu Jul 16 23:06:51 PDT 2015 --  It's like the list of things that resonate with me is infinitely expanding as I live and learn
Thu Jul 16 23:03:59 PDT 2015 --  Actually, I don't even think I have a favorite anything anymore. I'm truly starting to accept everything

Thu Jul 16 14:29:20 PDT 2015 --  I've been broke af plenty of times but I always climbed out of it by trying to provide work/services for money instead of begging for it
Thu Jul 16 14:24:21 PDT 2015 --  I'm always willing to help the less fortunate, but most don't even try to help themselves so wtf man

Wed Jul 15 07:03:54 PDT 2015 --  I try my best to give myself something enjoyable to watch as much as possible but when it doesn't work out like that, I just accept whatever
Wed Jul 15 07:00:53 PDT 2015 --  I don't really care what happens to "me" bc the real me is just the one watching it all take place.
Wed Jul 15 06:57:07 PDT 2015 --  When shitty things happen to me I just watch the turmoil from a 3rd person POV & then I go back to being "me" & watch myself climb out of it
Wed Jul 15 06:49:30 PDT 2015 --  America is full of pussies, they even get conned into paying a bill every month bc they're scared of what may happen to them lol
Wed Jul 15 06:47:29 PDT 2015 --  No point of being scared of what may happen, just let shit happen then deal with it accordingly
Wed Jul 15 06:43:46 PDT 2015 --  Preventative measures inhibit possibilities. I'm brave enough to take whatever happens in life and find a way to adapt to it.
Wed Jul 15 06:39:47 PDT 2015 --  Karmic retribution will deal with you if you do me wrong, it's not up to me to put up walls to prevent that shit from happening
Wed Jul 15 06:35:57 PDT 2015 --  No one my age can comprehend why I don't have trust issues so I guess we're both misunderstood https://twitter.com/sad_trap_girl/status/621311290225655808 …

Wed Jul 15 06:22:29 PDT 2015 --  It was only a matter of time before this shit happened again. Gotdamn I'm so disappointed in myself
Tue Jul 14 22:30:44 PDT 2015 --  If it makes you feel good, then who am I to try to change that even if it is a bad habit?
Tue Jul 14 21:46:27 PDT 2015 --  I guess we'll always have memories that we can talk people's heads off with forever but a story can never compensate for being in the moment
Tue Jul 14 21:43:21 PDT 2015 --  It's kinda disappointing how we work so hard to experience something then it comes and goes like it's nothing
Tue Jul 14 21:37:21 PDT 2015 --  We'll even invest months or years worth of energy just to have it and once the moment is gone we start working on another one
