Sun Aug 16 18:13:50 PDT 2015 --  Union will (correctly) blame officiating and continue their "woe is me" organizational attitude, but they once again led and failed to win.

Sat Aug 15 15:15:02 PDT 2015 --  If Matt Jones pulls off this shot from the hospitality tent, he should chug a beer in celebration.

Thu Aug 06 09:57:52 PDT 2015 --  Cognitive dissonance is alive and well, and it is on full display on Twitter today.
Thu Aug 06 09:45:29 PDT 2015 --  Good rule for today: Don't Twitter search "Patrick Kane" today. Follow-up: If you DO search "Patrick Kane," don't RT that shit.
Thu Aug 06 09:42:54 PDT 2015 --  Maybe dumb sports fans need to sit back for once and listen to women. Just a tip.
Thu Aug 06 09:41:00 PDT 2015 --  @nburzych Best part is how "he changed" and "matured" after getting a girlfriend. Uh, whoops...lol. Good call there.
Thu Aug 06 09:39:49 PDT 2015 --  So the "well maybe she was just drunk" defense don't fly. Go home and jerk off. Booty call somebody you've banged before.
Thu Aug 06 09:39:19 PDT 2015 --  Also, if you need to hit ass so badly you put yourself to lose everything, you're still an idiot.
Thu Aug 06 09:38:04 PDT 2015 --  I've been both a rape victim and a criminal defense attorney who defended rapists. So take your claims of bias and shove them.

Thu Aug 06 09:35:03 PDT 2015 --  He's such an idiot. It's literally the one thing he couldn't do and get away with. Like literally, do anything else and your fine.
Thu Aug 06 09:33:01 PDT 2015 --  And the fan boys and girls are now going to paint Kane's accuser out as the villain in this too. Which is going to be the worst part.
Thu Aug 06 09:32:31 PDT 2015 --  Everyone knew Kane was a drunk. And that's fine. Big distinction of being a drunk and being someone who is accused of rape.
Thu Aug 06 09:39:16 PDT 2015 --  Don't know if Kane did anything or not, but I can say with certainty that he's a piece of shit.
Thu Aug 06 09:18:09 PDT 2015 --  @RealFansProgram It's not a column about him being guilty of these allegations. It's about him being a piece of shit. Which he clearly is.
