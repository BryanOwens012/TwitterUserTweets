Mon Aug 24 19:01:23 PDT 2015 --  Eovaldi's ERA is under 3 since that Miami game #Yankees
Mon Aug 24 18:56:42 PDT 2015 --  Good shit Beltran
Mon Aug 24 18:55:01 PDT 2015 --  Eovaldi's last 2 starts especially have been Great. Getting better with his splitter is a huge part
Mon Aug 24 18:53:32 PDT 2015 --  That's the Ollie Perez I remember on the Mets
Mon Aug 24 13:57:21 PDT 2015 --  Gabriel impressed me a lot! Chambers looked like a player who hasnt been playing recently.
Mon Aug 24 13:57:21 PDT 2015 --  "Koscielny and Per are like new signings" - Wenger later this week
Mon Aug 24 13:56:54 PDT 2015 --  Wenger and the board will let the fans down just like the Yankees/Cashman by doing nothing the rest of the window too, huh
Mon Aug 24 13:52:25 PDT 2015 --  What a joke. Every other sport has replay these days even fkn baseball. THe match ended 1-0 #Arsenal
Mon Aug 24 13:30:04 PDT 2015 --  gotta feeling Walcotts gonna score #Arsenal pls
Mon Aug 24 12:55:56 PDT 2015 --  Show us that you can identify problems Wenger. Chambers is having an off day, do something about it before it costs us points.
Mon Aug 24 12:54:42 PDT 2015 --  Man if just one of Koscielny or Per could've played with Gabriel we'd have been much better.
Mon Aug 24 12:53:09 PDT 2015 --  I forgot Liverpool is owned by the Red Sox owner. Disgusting club all around tbf
Mon Aug 24 12:32:30 PDT 2015 --  Just started the match. What BS on that Ramsey offside. I swear if we end up losin by a goal or drawing im gonna be livid. #Arsenal #Gunners
Sun Aug 23 14:29:19 PDT 2015 --  Everyone but Cashman and the FO apologists saw this coming, smh. We didnt have to give up Sev, Bird or Judge. Mateo tho w/ Didi here?
Sun Aug 23 14:19:25 PDT 2015 --  That was such a great decision to do nothing at the deadline in regards to pitching. Really payin off #Yankees
Fri Aug 21 19:26:54 PDT 2015 --  Just Stephen Drew doing Stephen Drew things
Fri Aug 21 19:18:49 PDT 2015 --  god damn that was an awful error. We'll take it tho 4-3. #Yankees
Fri Aug 21 18:54:20 PDT 2015 --  That was an impressive drive and TD pass by Petty #Jets
Fri Aug 21 17:44:54 PDT 2015 --  In the first half of tonight’s game, Leonard Williams has five tackles, two sacks and a safety. That’s, uh, good.. #Jets
Fri Aug 21 18:14:32 PDT 2015 --  annnnddd another penalty smh #Jets
Fri Aug 21 18:13:41 PDT 2015 --  Petty real lucky not to turn it over
Fri Aug 21 18:07:44 PDT 2015 --  nice pick #Jets
Fri Aug 21 18:07:29 PDT 2015 --  can we chill with all the penalties #jets
Thu Aug 20 18:21:46 PDT 2015 --  Tyrod Taylor is buns Terrelle Pryor with less talent
Thu Aug 20 17:38:37 PDT 2015 --  They're less loaded than the #Jets. Only position they have an advantage at is RB. Our 2ndary >. Our OL >. Our WRs >. D-Line is a wash
Thu Aug 20 17:36:40 PDT 2015 --  Annoying as hell to hear "The Bills are loaded, their a contender if they get decent QB play"...
Thu Aug 20 17:31:40 PDT 2015 --  #SeeYa! @AROD launches one deep to left. #Yankees now trail Indians, 3-1.
Wed Aug 19 18:32:46 PDT 2015 --  The new Rockstar Whipped Strawberry >>>
Wed Aug 19 10:23:37 PDT 2015 --  Yeah no Michael Kay, the Red Sox miraculously making the playoffs would not be a positive.
Tue Aug 18 19:01:31 PDT 2015 --  im dying at the #Yankees official twitter breaking out #BaeRod
Tue Aug 18 18:52:26 PDT 2015 --  GRAND SLAM! #BAEROD pic.twitter.com/SU2wAF84ex
Tue Aug 18 16:56:32 PDT 2015 --  CC looking good yet again tonight, pls keep it going through the rest of the season
Tue Aug 18 16:52:51 PDT 2015 --  I would've rathered we offered Tennessee a 4th for Mettenberger
Tue Aug 18 16:14:13 PDT 2015 --  is it fucked up that I legit thought Tommy Lasorda died years ago
Tue Aug 18 15:55:59 PDT 2015 --  New @SUBWAY theme song after Jared Fogle incident. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmDcCpD1gc …
Mon Aug 17 20:56:09 PDT 2015 --  Brian McCann: 1st Yankee to have at least 5 RBI. 3 caught stealing (as a C) in same game Last to do: Brad Ausmus, 2003 (via @eliassports)
Mon Aug 17 20:27:19 PDT 2015 --  dmize MD https://twitter.com/dmizee/status/633426911448985600 … I think that was best case scenario all things considered
Mon Aug 17 20:23:02 PDT 2015 --  NUNEZZZZZZZZZ HAHAHAHAHA
Mon Aug 17 20:22:52 PDT 2015 --  Greg Bird started that inning. Just love how comfortable and hitterish he looks.
Mon Aug 17 20:22:40 PDT 2015 --  Payback for hittin Mitchell in the face right there Nunez #Yankees
Mon Aug 17 17:02:02 PDT 2015 --  nice pitch to get outta that
Mon Aug 17 17:00:02 PDT 2015 --  Glad to hear Barnes is dealing. Really wish he wasn't on the Red Sox though.
Mon Aug 17 16:55:18 PDT 2015 --  my first impression is that it broke his nose. Just glad he didn't take it directly to the head.
Mon Aug 17 16:54:16 PDT 2015 --  Really hope Mitchells okay. Didn't look that bad until I saw blood pouring down his hands. dammmnnn
Mon Aug 17 16:53:47 PDT 2015 --  DAMN okay hes really bleeding
Mon Aug 17 16:37:01 PDT 2015 --  Great start
Mon Aug 17 16:36:22 PDT 2015 --  F yea McCann. On an 0-2 pitch too
Mon Aug 17 16:35:30 PDT 2015 --  Get out
Mon Aug 17 16:24:50 PDT 2015 --  15mil per for Valanciunas would be a really solid deal for the Raps. Bet he would get 20 next summer.
Mon Aug 17 16:07:22 PDT 2015 --  The 1st place #Yankees are finally home in the Bronx and it's time to take care of business! Let's go boys #NYY pic.twitter.com/nXAlbMpqXb
Mon Aug 17 15:49:31 PDT 2015 --  http://hoopshabit.com/2015/08/10/jeremy-lin-qa-setting-the-record-straight-with-nathan-gottlieb/ … "I believe Lin is a better overall PG than Kemba Walker" Someone needs to get this guy some psychological help
Mon Aug 17 15:43:34 PDT 2015 --  "Barnes is from that baseball factory - #UConn" - @MutWEEI on the @RedSox pregame show. #BleedBlue
Mon Aug 17 15:41:25 PDT 2015 --  Here's a good example of someone who's not living in the same reality as the rest of us: @zukovka
Mon Aug 17 15:38:14 PDT 2015 --  http://hoopshabit.com/2015/08/10/jeremy-lin-qa-setting-the-record-straight-with-nathan-gottlieb/ … Easily one of the most hilarious articles I've ever read. Absolute delusion at it's worst. Compares Lin to T Parker
Mon Aug 17 14:07:50 PDT 2015 --  lol at BlueJay fans talking shit to CC cause they're finally relevant. But like their cities' rapper, they're gonna end up pissed on.
Mon Aug 17 13:55:22 PDT 2015 --  So Ryan Clark was the only one saying Geno put a finger in IK's face? SMH, someone check this dude for CTE.
