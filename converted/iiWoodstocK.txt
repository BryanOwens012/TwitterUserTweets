Mon Jun 29 13:21:41 PDT 2015 --  So the key takeaway here is the Kings have opened up usable cap space (net gain of about $4.4M) for the coming season. That appears a given.
Mon Jun 29 13:18:46 PDT 2015 --  Just spit balling here, but if Richards/NHLPA grieve LAK termination, likelihood of grievance being heard this wk is virtually non-existent.
Mon Jun 29 13:14:30 PDT 2015 --  After termination of Mike Richards' contract, LAK face cap recapture penalty of $1.32M per year for each of the next five years.
Mon Jun 29 12:53:36 PDT 2015 --  Grievances often takes months, sometimes years, to be heard but request can be made for expedited hearing that sometimes take days or weeks.
Mon Jun 29 12:52:15 PDT 2015 --  If Richards/NHLPA file grievance over LAK termination, it will be heard by joint-appointed NHL-NHLPA Impartial Arbitrator.
Mon Jun 29 12:50:32 PDT 2015 --  Note: Even tho LAK terminated Richards' contract, they are still responsible for a cap recapture amount, per CBA.
Mon Jun 29 12:02:22 PDT 2015 --  It is likely player, his reps/NHLPA will dispute NHL/LAK interpretation tho low likelihood of anticipated grievance resolution before July 1
Mon Jun 29 11:58:39 PDT 2015 --  As far as NHL and LAK concerned, Kings are free of obligation to Richards and he's off LA cap, player eligible to sign anywhere.
Mon Jun 29 11:44:57 PDT 2015 --  In the meantime, I'd expect LA to take a run at re-signing either Andrej Sekera or Justin Williams.
Mon Jun 29 11:43:30 PDT 2015 --  I'm going to suspect Richards and his representatives may not see it the same way. Stay tuned on that.
Mon Jun 29 11:42:28 PDT 2015 --  It is a given the Kings believe this move frees them of their contractual obligation to Richards and his $5.75M cap hit.
Mon Jun 29 11:39:43 PDT 2015 --  Suffice to say it's extremely complicated and many lawyers are going to be very busy sorting this one out.
Mon Jun 29 11:37:36 PDT 2015 --  On LA terminating Mike Richards' contract for "material breach," there are myriad reasons why details can't be made public at this time.
Mon Jun 29 11:33:35 PDT 2015 --  The #LAKings have issued the following statement and will not comment any further at this time. https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce53vwciw/og8r …
