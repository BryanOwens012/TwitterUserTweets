Mon Aug 17 20:59:37 PDT 2015 --  ...or just i remember why i wanted to do the story, what was that it made me to begin this journey, and the motivation comes again! :D
Mon Aug 17 20:58:15 PDT 2015 --  4.- Keep fun, keep passion and keep motivated: When i`m low of motivation, i read some comics/manga, inspirational sentences, listen music..
Mon Aug 17 20:56:17 PDT 2015 --  ..I calculate how much average time i take in every activity, then i do my schedule and i try to keep on it as much as i can
Mon Aug 17 20:54:20 PDT 2015 --  3.- I make a plan for every chapter: write dialogues, thumbnails of pages, sketches, pencil, ink, screentones and dialogues...
Mon Aug 17 20:53:16 PDT 2015 --  2.- I have my own "ritual": coffee, incense and music. That put me in the mood to focus only in drawing. It`s an habit for me.
Mon Aug 17 20:52:10 PDT 2015 --  1.-I try as much as i can to draw at the same hour. So i know as i havean exactly hour to begin my formal work, i have it to work in manga

Mon Aug 17 20:49:32 PDT 2015 --  So, here is when habits and self discipline are the best way to continue your way like manga ka,
Mon Aug 17 20:48:37 PDT 2015 --  I found myself procrastinating when i`m under art block.
Mon Aug 17 20:47:49 PDT 2015 --  It`s easy to procrastinate when you don`t have your own schedule, and maybe you can lost your passion for the story in the way.
Mon Aug 17 20:47:10 PDT 2015 --  ..What about when nobody but yourself have to say the amount of pages to do?
Mon Aug 17 20:46:36 PDT 2015 --  When you work for someone, you know you have to complete a quantity of pages during a frame of time, but...
Mon Aug 17 20:44:02 PDT 2015 --  Let`s talk today about discipline when you are an independent manga ka ^^

Fri Aug 14 21:19:07 PDT 2015 --  I wonder: How Gersiel would react to this situation? How would do it Krysiel? And finally How would I face it?
