Thu Oct 02 18:57:39 PDT 2014 --  Hey Packers can u learn to run Eddie Lacy who is averaging almost 7 yards per carry tonight. Fantasy football team needs him.
Sun Sep 14 06:46:55 PDT 2014 --  The NFL is becoming embarrassing. Kudos to the Vikings with AP. Carolina has winning on their mind and not women abuse. The NFL needs more
Fri Sep 12 03:50:18 PDT 2014 --  I try to get my 2 young daughters to support and be Steelers fans. My 10 year old says dad "they stink" and throws her jersey on the floor
Fri Sep 12 03:48:22 PDT 2014 --  Disappointing to know that Steelers again look this bad. Makes going to bed during games much easier. But u still wake up sick next morning
Thu Sep 11 19:27:43 PDT 2014 --  I can't stand the fact that the NFL is becoming so pathetic. College football is still a real game where players get hit. NFL this is boring
Mon Sep 08 11:33:02 PDT 2014 --  BTW how does a prosecutor see that and not put Rice behind bars?
Mon Sep 08 11:33:05 PDT 2014 --  So the Raven and one Harbaugh made a good decision. Now let's see if brother Harbaugh and the 49ers have the same views on dom violence
Sat Jul 12 11:22:37 PDT 2014 --  Great move Melo. Maybe he can be enshrined for most money made without winning a title. I like money but to have title equals priceless.
Fri Jul 11 16:07:53 PDT 2014 --  Carmelo would be stupid if he didn't sign with Bulls. The only chance he has to win a championship. He won't do it in New York. End of story
Thu May 22 18:58:11 PDT 2014 --  Do the pens go and get some great players.
Sun Dec 08 13:15:59 PST 2013 --  Steelers make me depressed.
Sun Nov 03 14:00:45 PST 2013 --  Whatever happened to our famous bunch formations. They worked great. Bunch of misfits.
Sun Nov 03 13:58:21 PST 2013 --  Good to see that this offense still sucks. Don't wait until the end of the season to get rid of asshat Haley. Do It now.
Sun Oct 13 19:58:22 PDT 2013 --  IPhone or android. What are ur thoughts.
Sun Sep 29 13:43:44 PDT 2013 --  Please tell me how pittsburgh thought that getting rid of key players and leaders was going to benefit them. Hope management wakes up
Mon Sep 16 20:42:56 PDT 2013 --  Pittsburgh needs to make changes. This thinking thatvthey can win with little is getting old. Change and bring in a good OC and another WR
Fri Jun 07 19:42:38 PDT 2013 --  Pens are just wild. Pay all that money play a whole season and really win it. Rather have Hartnell.
Sun Apr 14 18:18:16 PDT 2013 --  Join the 90 day challenge. A total health and weightloss transformation. Americas number 1 weightloss program. http://rstoklosa.myvi.net 
Sun Mar 24 14:23:25 PDT 2013 --  Again another disappointing loss to the ravens as they sign Dumerville and we have no one. Make a pick. Do something. Its so frustrating.
Sat Mar 16 05:39:11 PDT 2013 --  Pittsburgh oh pittsburgh please get some receivers. Why pay Ben big money if he has very few to throw to. I love AB JC and PB but add one
Fri Mar 15 06:35:41 PDT 2013 --  So depressing to see all these quality free agents gi and visit all these teams yet the steelers dont do anything. Its very frustrating.
Tue Mar 12 11:53:43 PDT 2013 --  I have not seen the Steelers take a different person in free agency in like 10 years. The bleacher report and Twitter hurts during this time
Sun Mar 10 09:43:40 PDT 2013 --  Good to see that all our players may end up on the Brown's this year. Thay will be awesome.
Sun Jan 20 15:33:26 PST 2013 --  Completely disappointed in the fact that Atlanta again couldn't put a game away. Matt ryan isn't the issue coaching should have been better
Wed Jan 16 08:34:52 PST 2013 --  We’re giving away a $700 gift card for #PensGear! RT by 1/16 4PM ET for chance to win! One entry per person. http://pens.pe/V2USIj  for rules
Sun Nov 04 10:19:42 PST 2012 --  I am liking the redskins uniforms. Think they should keep those for home.
Sat Jun 23 10:08:54 PDT 2012 --  I like doing shoulders the best. I think its my most intense workout that I put Max effort into.
Sat May 05 18:08:01 PDT 2012 --  Moon looks weird tonight pic.twitter.com/YrzRXDTv
Fri Apr 13 19:13:52 PDT 2012 --  Penguins just don't have a defense. The fact is that the offense is great but that doesn't mean u don't play defense. Even it up
Sun Apr 01 11:52:22 PDT 2012 --  The pens need to start playing as if they are an all star team. They are horrible. They are not playing like a playoff team.
Wed Mar 21 14:59:59 PDT 2012 --  I am not sure what the steelers expect to do at ILB but I would have loved to see Bart Scott in a Steelers Jersey.
Thu Mar 08 10:14:06 PST 2012 --  @RamonFoster how about a good place to find workouts for us that love working out but don't play. Always like to learn new things.
Sat Feb 18 18:29:49 PST 2012 --  Hey pens fans is crosby gonna play again or is he waiting until next year when he doesn't resign and goes and plays for Detroit for 60+ game
Sat Feb 18 18:28:33 PST 2012 --  @bkeisel99 any way to get a visit from a bunch of good steelers for the females I work for in a max secure juv facility. All good kids.
Mon Feb 13 23:18:18 PST 2012 --  Advice. Back surgery L4 is very slightly bulged and L5S1 is crushed. 2 options. Cut out the huge one and relieve pressure or fusion of both?
Sun Feb 12 11:18:57 PST 2012 --  @merrilhoge would the steelers even consider a player/coach spot for Hines Ward. He is a big part of the city and fans of.Pittsburgh.
Sun Feb 12 11:15:47 PST 2012 --  @tpolamalu looking to get signed things or even a planned visit for the residents I work with in a max secure juvi facility for females. LMK
Sun Feb 12 11:10:38 PST 2012 --  @jharrison9292 any chance to get a signed jersey or terrible towel for a display case in the max secure female juvi facility I work in PA.
Sun Feb 12 11:07:10 PST 2012 --  @mvp86hinesward it would be a shame if ur not there. Player/coach. U fit right in and ur a huge asset to the city and the team. Good luck
Sun Feb 12 11:04:26 PST 2012 --  I am a huge fan and the fact that the Steelers may release Hines is crazy. I am thinking player/coach. We need his energy with Pittsburgh
Mon Jan 16 03:57:26 PST 2012 --  I work in a Max secure girls juvenile facility and would love to have signed ball or Jersey as we have numerous Philly girls. Would meanalot
Sat Jan 14 18:43:21 PST 2012 --  Good job Pittsburgh u made tebow look like Brady last week but this week the real t Brady did stand up.
Mon Jan 02 12:35:49 PST 2012 --  I will say that PSU needs to hire an offensive minded coach and keep Bradley as the D coordinator. They need to have and O with that D.
Fri Dec 30 14:51:13 PST 2011 --  @tpolamalu and quit having hair envy since I am bald. Also love to get tic for me and wife cause she needs to love my team. I can't afford
Fri Dec 30 14:48:41 PST 2011 --  @tpolamalu no smoking while I drink casually with friends due to.major back issues. Get and autographed troy jersey and a James h auto jers
Wed Dec 14 06:30:29 PST 2011 --  Ray Lewis makes that same hit he gets nothing. Roger Goodell is trying to flex but will eventually flex himself out if this keeps happening.
Wed Dec 14 06:29:11 PST 2011 --  the NFL is looking at allowing the ravens or giving them the AFC north title by suspending JH. They lose at SD we win at SF we win division.
Sat Nov 26 04:55:12 PST 2011 --  Oh yea basketball is back. Who cares NBA is horrible basketball season was great cause it was college basketball and they play hard.
Mon Nov 07 04:10:26 PST 2011 --  @MikeAndMike Pittsburgh Steelers "cornerback kills us every year"--c ya
Sun Nov 06 20:49:52 PST 2011 --  Shame that again Gay is a bag of crap and the Steelers will never learn. They are going to get eating alive by all passing teams.
Wed Oct 05 14:17:32 PDT 2011 --  @MarkKaboly_Trib with all do repect ur tweets mean very little. Find out why our paid players of this year who got new $ aren't playing yet.
Sun Oct 02 19:42:19 PDT 2011 --  @Wallace17_daKid its just a shame that minus the superbowl wins it just sucks as a fan to know we have never had a good o line nor Cbs
Sun Oct 02 13:25:04 PDT 2011 --  The Steelers are so pathetic this year. Even when they were good and they won we still needed a o line and we never did it. Even secondary.
Sun Oct 02 13:21:06 PDT 2011 --  @merrilhoge as a huge Steelers fan when will we ever go against practice and start paying for a team. We need to get with the Joneses.
Wed Sep 28 21:38:10 PDT 2011 --  How disappointing is it to be a Red Sox fan. All that money and no playoffs. Theo and terry should be ashamed. Waiting sucks. Buy better.
Sun Sep 11 14:14:32 PDT 2011 --  @lawrencetimmons first week but flat next week means more worries.
Sun Sep 11 14:14:03 PDT 2011 --  @jharrison9292 I hope it gets better in the upcoming weeks.
Sat Aug 20 04:33:10 PDT 2011 --  @ochocinco that's some funny stuff right there. That could be a post game interview. Super hot rappin.
Sat Aug 13 09:57:03 PDT 2011 --  @SHANK_SPARTACUS @jamiedukes @is3jay @bearfns those steelers know that all it would take was some solid corners. Shame they don't spend.
Fri Aug 12 18:24:53 PDT 2011 --  @jamiedukes how do the Steelers give 200+ yards up to Rex Grossman in the first half. Why? Help a true fan understand!!!! Why. William Gay
Fri Aug 12 17:58:22 PDT 2011 --  @planetsteelers that's true and we rewarded him with a contract. Way to go.
Fri Aug 12 17:57:17 PDT 2011 --  Again looks like the secondary will kill the steelers again. 220 yards for Rex grossman. Really. Rex grossman. Cmon man.
Wed Aug 10 18:42:57 PDT 2011 --  @jharrison9292 yeah
Sat Aug 06 18:59:38 PDT 2011 --  @jharrison9292 would love to have something for my residents (girls) who I work for. Trying to make a display case of teams.
Sat Aug 06 18:58:31 PDT 2011 --  @reggie_bush how about an autographed something for my residents (girls) unit so we can have some displays. Trying to get some from all
Sat Aug 06 18:56:48 PDT 2011 --  @jharrison9292 u said first 3 right
Sat Aug 06 18:56:18 PDT 2011 --  @jharrison9292 washington
Sat Aug 06 08:23:32 PDT 2011 --  @tpolamalu I work for girls juvenile detention in PA we always do eagles things but never steelers nation. My girls would love something
Sat Aug 06 08:22:08 PDT 2011 --  @JodySmith_ yes.
Sat Aug 06 08:21:39 PDT 2011 --  @tpolamalu mr Polamalu I tweeted LTimmons about help with a signed picture or football from the team he has all tweets regarding my job and
Sat Aug 06 06:58:01 PDT 2011 --  @steelers please see l Timmons about a tweet I sent him. It would mean alot if you guys could do something. Only one true PA team. Steelers.
Sat Aug 06 06:55:29 PDT 2011 --  @lawrencetimmons so I don't have to hear trash talk. It would mean alot. I will send address if u guys could plus it would mean lots to kids
Sat Aug 06 06:53:51 PDT 2011 --  @lawrencetimmons the bad is that they get passes to eagles camp last 2 years. Cause we r closer. Any way we can get something from steelers
Sat Aug 06 06:52:07 PDT 2011 --  @lawrencetimmons just asking but I work in a max secure girls juvenile facility and I am a hardcore steelers fan and so are some girls
Wed Aug 03 18:26:59 PDT 2011 --  @girlscircle I would love the ability to get some info or speak to Someone about the girls circle. I work with at risk girl an like newideas
Mon Aug 01 19:10:10 PDT 2011 --  So crazy tired. Someone give me the best 4 picks to go with in regards to fantasy football this year.
Sat Jul 30 16:28:07 PDT 2011 --  I think the steelers should grab plax and then sign Kelvin Hayden whom the colts just released. Keep up.
Fri Jul 29 15:34:06 PDT 2011 --  @richeisen I would like to know if the steelers were able to get a corner. Would the defense they have be that much better. Trade for Asante
Fri Jul 29 15:30:38 PDT 2011 --  Steelers need another cornerback. Trade for Asante Samuels and get him. Samuels and Ike would make me feel better. Steelers need a corner
Thu Jul 28 17:01:10 PDT 2011 --  @richeisen would the steelers benefit if they acquired johnathon Joseph as another corner opposite of Ike Taylor.
Thu Jul 28 16:59:45 PDT 2011 --  @LaMarrWoodley good luck this season and let's get back. By the way. Jonathon Joseph would be awesome.
Thu Jul 28 16:58:47 PDT 2011 --  @steelers jonathon Joseph. Great addition. Please.
Sat May 21 11:20:15 PDT 2011 --  @R_Mendenhall love to have some of u guys speak. Just asking. Not sure if u guys do that.
Sat May 21 11:19:00 PDT 2011 --  @R_Mendenhall do u guys ever do any appearances. I work in a juvenile facility with females but there are 6 boys programs as well.
Tue May 03 19:43:39 PDT 2011 --  @R_Mendenhall huge fan bro. Love the steelers and love that we have a back now but Not sure if those were the right words.
Tue May 03 19:40:25 PDT 2011 --  @reggie_bush just asking. Didn't George Bush start the pursuit for him Mr.Bush.
Tue May 03 19:38:55 PDT 2011 --  @PTIShow as a Steelers fan and a person glad to have a legit running back I see his comments as moronic and believe he should be sat down.
Sat Apr 30 20:26:32 PDT 2011 --  @AdamSchefter is there really a true chance that we may look into Reggie Bush. I am a steelers fan for years now. Anyways good to see u@ESPN
Sat Apr 30 20:23:19 PDT 2011 --  @terrellowens trump would negotiate oil barrels down with the slick hair do. People don't know he hides an arsenal up there.
Sat Apr 30 20:20:16 PDT 2011 --  @LaMarrWoodley right on....well any ways hope they open the doors and get started soon. Hope training is going well with all that's going on
Sat Apr 30 18:10:22 PDT 2011 --  @LaMarrWoodley that's funny. I hate to say but u guys still need some moves for your defense. The line and line backers need support from CB
Sat Apr 30 09:45:34 PDT 2011 --  @R_Mendenhall it's a very typical thing that happens. Good luck with the upcoming season
Sat Apr 30 08:43:40 PDT 2011 --  @girlscircle just started following. Very interested in your program. Work with at risk youth and alway look for new ideas and programs.
Sat Apr 30 08:41:07 PDT 2011 --  @tpolamalu great pickup indeed. Good lick with next season and good to see someone like u my family can look up to as a sports figure. Thanx
Sat Apr 30 08:35:18 PDT 2011 --  @mvp86hinesward great pickup and much needed to rest "the beard" and Smith. Love the show as well. Happy dancing!!
Sat Apr 30 07:38:57 PDT 2011 --  @AdamSchefter will the Pittsburgh Steelers reach out to try and pick up Nhamdi from the Raiders or via free agency....no real CB since ROD
Sat Apr 30 07:37:02 PDT 2011 --  @reggie_bush heard Adam Schefter state that you may potentially be looked at by the Steelers if not in NO (sorry)...but awesome for Pitts!!
Sat Apr 30 07:33:29 PDT 2011 --  Huge Steelers fan and I would like to say corner back..............please Rooney's!!!!!!
Sat Apr 30 07:07:32 PDT 2011 --  The NFL draft this year has been so-so but as a Pittsburgh fan is really stinks that u need a CB and the Raven take Smith ahead of us
Thu Sep 02 17:45:22 PDT 2010 --  @KhloeKardashian Yeah. Partying at bloomsburg u. What's up with the Lakers. Is Lamar a believer in Miami and the bullshit that lebron did.
Tue Aug 31 14:11:29 PDT 2010 --  Sitting at home and wondering if Brett favre will make it throughout the season.
Fri Aug 27 10:25:24 PDT 2010 --  Sitting at work waiting for the weekend and getting ready fora some foot all this weekend.
