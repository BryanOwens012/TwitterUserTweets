Sat Aug 29 12:33:32 PDT 2015 --  And even that was because we went 3-0 down in the 92nd minute.
Sat Aug 29 12:31:21 PDT 2015 --  This was the first game I'd ever really thought about leaving early.

Sat Aug 29 12:23:27 PDT 2015 --  If Lovren starts vs United, I'm not even gonna bother to watch.
Sat Aug 29 10:05:18 PDT 2015 --  By the way, I'd never heard of the Lanzini guy so I knew he was gonna score.
Sat Aug 29 09:55:18 PDT 2015 --  Oh and we can't play Coutinho vs United. Yay...
Sat Aug 29 09:53:24 PDT 2015 --  Harry Kane's shit now.
Sat Aug 29 09:52:01 PDT 2015 --  As much as I don't want it to happen (because it means we failed), I think Rodgers won't be here by June.
Sat Aug 29 09:46:59 PDT 2015 --  Almost as if they consider being dominated and losing 3-0 to West Ham at Anfield is completely acceptable.
Sat Aug 29 09:44:40 PDT 2015 --  People throwing out the fake quote from Shankly about "if you can't support us when we lose... yadda yadda yadda" as if you can't complain.
Sat Aug 29 09:43:18 PDT 2015 --  Hey lads, can we ban Kevin Friend from ever entering this city again? @lpoolcouncil
Sat Aug 29 09:40:22 PDT 2015 --  The only brightside of today is the fact Chelsea lost at home so it takes a bit of notice off of us.
Sat Aug 29 09:35:32 PDT 2015 --  1. West Ham deserved to win. 2. Their fans are shit. 3. They're fucking knobheads.
Sat Aug 29 09:33:58 PDT 2015 --  Oh and I've never seen Anfield hate a referee more than that.
Sat Aug 29 09:31:10 PDT 2015 --  What was Phil's first yellow for anyway? I missed that completely.
Sat Aug 29 09:30:48 PDT 2015 --  Brendan Rodgers has a lot to fucking answer for after that shite.
Sat Aug 29 09:29:59 PDT 2015 --  Why was Emre taken off instead of Lucas? Why did we go 5 at the back? We needed to score 2. Why take off the only skillful player left?
Sat Aug 29 09:26:34 PDT 2015 --  WHY THE FUCK IS DEJAN LOVREN HAVING A SHOT FROM 40 YARDS OUT OUR ONLY ONE ON TARGET AGAINST A GUY WHO LET 4 IN VS BOURNEMOUTH?
Sat Aug 29 09:25:39 PDT 2015 --  Except for the fact he's proven himself to be good, Dejan Lovren constantly disappoints. https://twitter.com/LFCblogster/status/637662154775248896 …
Sat Aug 29 09:05:50 PDT 2015 --  That literally couldn't have gone worse.
Sat Aug 29 09:01:22 PDT 2015 --  Sakho scoring for them is a sign Sakho should be starting for us.
Sat Aug 29 08:01:57 PDT 2015 --  Have we ever comeback from behind to win a match under Rodgers? I honestly don't know.
Sat Aug 29 08:00:25 PDT 2015 --  Moreno and Ings look like coming on.
Sat Aug 29 07:54:41 PDT 2015 --  Our best CB pairing has to be Sakho-Gomez. Both Lovren-Skrtel dont have proper defending brain.
Sat Aug 29 07:59:08 PDT 2015 --  Want Lovren back? We'll give you another £20m @SouthamptonFC
Sat Aug 29 07:57:46 PDT 2015 --  Just when he finally gets some trust with me Dejan Lovren just wants to throw it away. Fucks sake.
Sat Aug 29 06:42:18 PDT 2015 --  Eventful day at Anfield so far. I'm a few feet away from Joe Gomez and had to limbo under a camera.
Sat Aug 29 06:38:43 PDT 2015 --  Someone get a big joe gomez banner on the kop.
Sat Aug 29 06:34:44 PDT 2015 --  Big Joe Gomez and the lads #LFC pic.twitter.com/rkc9VDFYQW
Sat Aug 29 05:44:58 PDT 2015 --  About to head up to Anfield now. Up the reds. #LFC
Sat Aug 29 05:05:27 PDT 2015 --  Mitrovic is fucking mental. 3 yellows and a red in 4 games. He's probably 19th in the fair play table by himself. (West Ham obviously last)
Sat Aug 29 03:31:47 PDT 2015 --  Still kind of annoyed Matt died in my playthrough of #UntilDawn. (Not a spoiler, everyone can die depending on choices)
Fri Aug 28 18:36:44 PDT 2015 --  Solid 8/10 game.
Fri Aug 28 18:21:15 PDT 2015 --  Finished Until Dawn. Really good game imo. I wouldn't say it's one of my favourites ever but worth the money and will probably replay it.
Thu Jul 02 11:58:08 PDT 2015 --  *slams hands on table* HOW DID BUZZ KNOW TO FREEZE AROUND HUMANS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A TOY, CAROL?
Fri Aug 28 16:14:09 PDT 2015 --  Bad cunt you. @DamianLFCpl
Fri Aug 28 13:36:23 PDT 2015 --  I'm not shocked that it's transpired that Ryan Babel is a knobhead.
Fri Aug 28 07:01:58 PDT 2015 --  About to start Until Dawn, hope it's good. Love games where the story changes based on your decisions.
Fri Aug 28 06:39:31 PDT 2015 --  Boss that none of our games after Europa League fixtures are outside of this city.

Fri Aug 28 05:11:14 PDT 2015 --  Liverpool team for Rubin Kazan (A): Bogdan, McLaughlin, Sakho, Toure, Moreno/Flanagan, Rossiter, Allen, Brannagan, Teixeira, Kent, Yesil.
Fri Aug 28 05:06:37 PDT 2015 --  LFC: W2, D1, L0 Sion: W2, D2, L2 Bordeaux: W0, D2, L1 Kazan: W1, D0, L5. I know it's pointless, just wanted to throw them out there.
Fri Aug 28 04:58:06 PDT 2015 --  Kinda want to get to Bordeaux away.
Fri Aug 28 04:57:47 PDT 2015 --  Tell us everything Bordeaux told you. @TiagoIlori4
Fri Aug 28 04:56:53 PDT 2015 --  Remember when we had to take Besiktas to penalties in Turkey at midnight there time and were forced to play a 12pm kick off on Sunday?
Fri Aug 28 04:55:55 PDT 2015 --  Can you give us MNF after our Rubin Kazan away? @SkySports
Fri Aug 28 04:49:53 PDT 2015 --  Everyone is acting like Rubin Kazan is the toughest game in the group. In their 6 league games this season they've won one and lost five.
Fri Aug 28 04:47:01 PDT 2015 --  And Krasnodar. And PAOK. It's the easiest group you could get but ti's the one that would piss me off most.
Fri Aug 28 04:45:42 PDT 2015 --  Dortmund got Gabala. Ouch.
Fri Aug 28 04:45:24 PDT 2015 --  Decent group, pissed about Rubin Kazan but it's only one long journey.
Fri Aug 28 04:42:39 PDT 2015 --  if we get some team for Azerbaijan I';m killing myself. Rubin Kazan is a journey that can already fuck off.

Thu Aug 27 18:39:39 PDT 2015 --  Remember when Suarez bit Ivanovic didn't get punished in the game and then scored the equaliser in the 96th min vs Chelsea for added needle
Thu Aug 27 18:19:54 PDT 2015 --  Luis Suarez could be 97 and in a wheelchair and I'd still want him back at LFC.
