Sun Jun 14 20:57:06 PDT 2015 --  Lebron just said, "I'm the best player in the world." Yeah we know. But be humble. No one likes someone who sucks their own ego.
Sun Jun 14 20:42:21 PDT 2015 --  Don't be mad Blatt. Just come back and win if you wanna be a dick.
Sun Jun 14 20:41:17 PDT 2015 --  WOW. He is being an asshole. Get him off the podium.
Sun Jun 14 19:53:18 PDT 2015 --  Now GoldenSt faces huge G6 issue: How long can they stay w/ primary LeBron defender Iguodala if Cavs go quickly to Hack-an-Iggy?
Sun Jun 14 19:50:37 PDT 2015 --  Life or death for Lebron & GS has a chance to win it on the King's court.
Sun Jun 14 19:50:01 PDT 2015 --  Game 6 is going to be EPIC.
Sun Jun 14 19:47:08 PDT 2015 --  With 1:30 left, Curry still gives no fucks. #3son3son3s

Thu Jun 11 20:23:02 PDT 2015 --  Finally GS gets a rebound..FINALLY
Thu Jun 11 20:01:34 PDT 2015 --  I can't watch GS turn over another game to the CAVS. Not after how close these games have been.
Thu Jun 11 19:15:39 PDT 2015 --  I have an apt Saturday but damn..I have something to do tomorrow

Tue Jun 09 20:54:07 PDT 2015 --  This is a tripy ass series
Tue Jun 09 20:47:35 PDT 2015 --  That's GSt's ball. Klay had no possession when touching ball. No foul. Delly just tried to save it, threw it to Warriors.
Tue Jun 09 20:47:53 PDT 2015 --  NBA refs; smh at y'all
Tue Jun 09 20:43:54 PDT 2015 --  THIS GAME IS CRAZY.

Tue Jun 09 19:47:36 PDT 2015 --  I gotta say @StephenCurry30 is totally absent. This is unbelievable. I can't decide whether he's scared or frustrating. @RealSkipBayless is
Tue Jun 09 19:50:07 PDT 2015 --  GS is flustered and I definitely understand.
Tue Jun 09 19:42:34 PDT 2015 --  OMG
Tue Jun 09 19:42:09 PDT 2015 --  Curry just made his first shot since 1st Q. Let's goooooo

Sun Jun 07 20:11:35 PDT 2015 --  LeBron knows better than to catch the jump ball. Should've batted it out.

Sun Jun 07 19:36:43 PDT 2015 --  If Curry was on his game tonight, GS would've had this game.
Sun Jun 07 19:27:34 PDT 2015 --  What's up with Curry tonight? He's off his game.
Sun Jun 07 19:11:46 PDT 2015 --  At what point do you accept that you are not supposed to take a certain path in life?
Sun Jun 07 16:00:09 PDT 2015 --  Maggie literally goes batshit crazy if I'm not in the room.
Sun Jun 07 08:59:41 PDT 2015 --  If I've learned a thing from the past two years, never allow someone distract you. It leads you off track while they take off.
Sat Jun 06 20:53:18 PDT 2015 --  I'm so tired of trusting people and they just turn around and treat me like shit.
Sat Jun 06 13:44:07 PDT 2015 --  That's what happens when you've been single for too long, you start looking at DILFS.

Fri Jun 05 18:32:22 PDT 2015 --  I'm literally pushing people away to make room for someone that won't make time for me anymore. Smh.
Fri Jun 05 18:31:50 PDT 2015 --  Idk why I do this to myself.
Fri Jun 05 14:40:53 PDT 2015 --  Terrible news for Kyrie, Cavs. He's had one injury after another, from head to toe. So gifted, so injury-prone. So sorry for him.
Fri Jun 05 08:53:51 PDT 2015 --  Who's taking this surf&turf cooking class with me June 19th? It's $65...so...anyone?
