Wed Sep 17 13:40:30 PDT 2014 --  There are a lot of not-as-good players who were released wondering why they couldn't get the "exempt-list" deal. Pay for no play.
Wed Sep 17 09:18:28 PDT 2014 --  Spielman lauding Peterson for "unselfish" role in exemption. Me: He's being paid fully not to play while under indictment for child abuse
Wed Sep 17 07:10:22 PDT 2014 --  Let's be real here: this was a negotiation, pure and simple. AP goes away, gets paid, Vikings get heat off, NFL parks him on a list.

Mon Sep 15 08:54:57 PDT 2014 --  The Wilfs were out in front of Chris Cook and AJ Jefferson domestic violence cases in 2011 and 2013. Suspended and released, respectively.
Mon Sep 15 09:17:48 PDT 2014 --  On 11/25/13 the Vikings' AJ Jefferson was arrested on domestic assault charges. He was released an hour later. Due process?
Mon Sep 15 09:23:22 PDT 2014 --  The Vikings' statement on Adrian Peterson - "Fuck you all, we got a stadium, no takesbacksies! Come watch us play! Oh, and uh, due process."
