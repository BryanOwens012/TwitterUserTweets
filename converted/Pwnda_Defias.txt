Sat Mar 14 12:57:26 PDT 2015 --  The silent killer of content here is the RNG of Warforged Gear for Mythic Raiding as well. The iLevel buff only makes that even stronger.
Fri Mar 13 08:31:11 PDT 2015 --  Play a Brewmaster Monk in #Warcraft? Then don't miss this interview with LeBlue http://bit.ly/1aZyLzj

Sat Feb 14 11:05:17 PST 2015 --  @WarcraftDevs Any chance to see Life Cocoon come off GCD for MW? It feels bad to have a "tank" CD be on GCD when others aren't
Tue Feb 24 16:34:54 PST 2015 --  @Wowhead Listen, y'all have a nice site and I love it, but if you want to not be adblocked by people you need to get rid of these noisy ads.

Fri Jan 23 22:03:15 PST 2015 --  @Celestalon thanks for telling MWs they can't pvp, be low geared, or do CMs after 6.1. Meanwhile our mastery is still complete trash!
Fri Jan 23 17:49:11 PST 2015 --  @WarcraftDevs @Celestalon Concerned about the Mana Tea change for PvP mistweavers \ undergeared mistweavers. Going to hurt them a ton.
Tue Jan 06 16:40:52 PST 2015 --  Hotfix applied: The PvP duration of Kidney Shot is now a max of 6 seconds for all specs.

Tue Nov 25 23:40:59 PST 2014 --  Favorite/retweet if you enjoyed obliterating this NPC as much as I did! I'm at 12 times and counting! pic.twitter.com/XkbNfvzcYS
Tue Nov 25 10:12:43 PST 2014 --  Bunch of class tuning hotfixes went live overnight. @Rygarius will have full details in the hotfix blog ASAP.

Mon Nov 03 08:18:06 PST 2014 --  @Celestalon If I'm correct, Gift of the Serpent can multistrike when people pick them up and when it explodes. What about orb spawning?
Thu Oct 30 07:02:35 PDT 2014 --  Fixed some issues with Gift of the Serpent Tracker. Should now always show even with 0 orbs. Cleaned up the code. http://pastebin.com/a9bhyPvE

Fri Sep 12 16:41:29 PDT 2014 --  . @Celestalon @Apkolino It baffles me how little you identify with us. No way you can average 6 or 5 heals on Uplift. Even 4 might be hard.
Fri Sep 12 16:37:09 PDT 2014 --  . @Celestalon @Apkolino You mean up to 20 seconds ago? If ReM lasted 10 seconds cast every ~5 seconds the world of MW would be very different
