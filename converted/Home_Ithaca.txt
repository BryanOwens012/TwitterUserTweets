Tue Oct 28 19:09:50 PDT 2014 --  OH ALSO look at this totally attractive portrait Calypso made for me: pic.twitter.com/4lfnGYIsip
Tue Oct 28 19:05:30 PDT 2014 --  I mean, like, seriously! YOU try winning the Trojan War and being like the master tactician!
Tue Oct 28 19:03:55 PDT 2014 --  Oh and always listen to me, because I'm always right.
Tue Oct 28 19:03:37 PDT 2014 --  Alright, listen up, people. We will get home. We will reach Ithaca. Stop worrying. Stop... mutiny-ing. Relax and just do your job.
Tue Oct 28 19:00:41 PDT 2014 --  They don't call me raider of cities for nothing ;)
Tue Oct 28 18:44:44 PDT 2014 --  Our next adventure was really extensive, so it's on my blog... here's the post: pic.twitter.com/C7784iCrMe
Tue Oct 28 17:54:33 PDT 2014 --  I literally had to tie them to the ships in order to get out of there! Ugh, never again am I going anywhere near!
Tue Oct 28 17:53:41 PDT 2014 --  Any crewmen who ate the lotus [...] their only wish to linger there [...] all memory of the journey home dissolved forever. #Homer214
Tue Oct 28 17:52:02 PDT 2014 --  That stuff really screws with your head, it's creepy...
Tue Oct 28 17:49:23 PDT 2014 --  Of course, another place for my men to get delayed.
Mon Oct 27 11:51:49 PDT 2014 --  So then we set sail once again, aaaand landed with the Lotus-Eaters. Perfect.
Mon Oct 27 11:51:19 PDT 2014 --  COME ON WE PROBABLY COULD’VE BEEN HOME AND BACK BY NOW GUYS
Mon Oct 27 11:50:58 PDT 2014 --  There I sacked the city, killed the men […] Then I urged them to cut and run […] but would they listen? Not those mutinous fools! #Homer213
Mon Oct 27 11:49:52 PDT 2014 --  I had to kill a bunch of the Cicones because they were in my way, and I’m just trying to get home.
Mon Oct 27 11:49:30 PDT 2014 --  And of course because we stayed they killed a bunch of us and chased us out. Literally.
Mon Oct 27 11:48:41 PDT 2014 --  Of course, why would they listen to me? I’m just, you know, that guy who’s gotten them through this entire war
Mon Oct 27 11:47:21 PDT 2014 --  So first we met the Cicones, and I wanted to leave really soon and be on our way, but my crew wouldn’t let me!
Mon Oct 27 11:46:58 PDT 2014 --  I left my little boy when he was a little baby, and who knows how Penelope's been lately... I JUST WANNA GET HOME!
Mon Oct 27 11:46:08 PDT 2014 --  I'm so done with this, I really just need to get home. NOW.
Mon Oct 27 11:45:22 PDT 2014 --  Man, it was really exhausting, but here goes, if you really wanna hear it all...
Mon Oct 27 11:44:44 PDT 2014 --  Just set up a Twitter to tell you people about my journey home!
