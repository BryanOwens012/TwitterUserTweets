Mon Jun 22 16:04:09 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb Thank you all! nice chatting with you via these little boxes and letters. See you soon!
Mon Jun 22 16:02:28 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @AphonicBooks I just wrapped up two James Franco projects that Im excited about and then Im developing some stuff behinf the camera
Mon Jun 22 16:00:02 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @ehovs2 Ive always been drawn to dark character driven dramas and thrillers... so probably something psychological and dark
Mon Jun 22 15:58:40 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @SwieSelina i can play a little guitar... and I really love creating stories.
Mon Jun 22 15:57:15 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @whoaeverlark maybe how to not drown when trying to surf... and I'd give him a hug.
Mon Jun 22 15:55:12 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @pizzaftidol I the type of person that watches the movie... haha
Mon Jun 22 15:53:36 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @AthmicaT Seeing someone fight so hard to maintain who they are and for what they love is inspiring i feel
Mon Jun 22 15:50:13 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @thepuce27 mostly interesting stories with characters that go on a journey. Complex characters with layers are the most realistic
Mon Jun 22 15:48:52 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @jhutcher_ I dont wanna give it away... but when Nick goes into the restaurant and... looses it. That was fun
Mon Jun 22 15:47:51 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @lwrenci Benecio is the MAN. He is so talented and giving as an actor. And it wasnt hard to play intimidated
Mon Jun 22 15:46:46 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @kellywithayy not very much because Nick didn't know who Pablo was. If i did then it'd require more willing suspense of disbelief.
Mon Jun 22 15:43:19 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @jihanfzein VERY!!! I suck at surfing! Im a snowboarder. I always feel like Im drowning when I TRY to surf!
Mon Jun 22 15:42:18 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @everlarksunset Intense. Tragic. Powerful.
Mon Jun 22 15:40:23 PDT 2015 --  . @IMDb @JohnG500 I really loved the role of Nick. I think he has a great arc and the world of Pablo has always been very fascinating.
