Tue Jan 17 19:28:53 PST 2012 --  @SuzeOrmanShow I am just curious more then anything. You know I support you on improving the credit scoring process in many many ways :)
Tue Jan 17 19:28:10 PST 2012 --  @SuzeOrmanShow Not to dig deeper, but are we talking about a whole new scoring system or just a reconfigured FICO or TransUnion score?
Tue Jan 17 19:21:34 PST 2012 --  @SuzeOrmanShow Quick ? is your hope to develop a new scoring system or for Transunion to alter their existing one? I know it is too early...

Sun Jan 15 16:05:40 PST 2012 --  @SuzeOrmanShow I read the article-I agree credit scores need to be drastically improved. My issue w/ scores is a lack of true transparency.
Sat Jan 14 10:15:42 PST 2012 --  @SuzeOrmanShow For what it is worth, I think you need to explain Chex Systems. I think most don't know you can be denied for a bank account.
