Tue Mar 10 19:22:19 PDT 2015 --  Couldnt ask for a better GM than TT Im so ecstatic that the Packers were able 2 keep both Cobb & Bulaga Both wanted 2 stay = winning culture

Sat Mar 07 20:46:45 PST 2015 --  Now @packers just need to resign Bulaga. Offense will be intact & can focus attention on ILB/D. Strong start to the new season.

Fri Dec 12 09:32:39 PST 2014 --  If the Badgers hire Paul Chyrst, are they accepting mediocrity (.500) for stability & familiarity? #lukewarm Prefer Aranda or Bevell
Thu Dec 11 14:31:00 PST 2014 --  Dave Aranda should have been given the chance to be the Badgers HC in the Outback Bowl. Aranda or Darrell Bevell are my 2 fav. candidates.
